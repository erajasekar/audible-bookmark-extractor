When will your competitor give up? Try it out with friends. In conclusion, accept this piece of wisdom about auctions from Warren Buffett. Don't go. If you happen to work in an industry where they're inevitable, set a maximum price and deduct 20% from this to offset the winner's curse.

Opening the newspaper, you learn that another CEO has been forced to step down because of bad results. In the sports section, you read that your team's winning season was thanks to player X or coach Y. In history books, you learn that the success of the French army in the early 1800s is a testament to Napoleon's superb leadership and strategy. Every story has a fate.
-  In history books, you learn that the success of the French army in the early 1800s is a testament to Napoleon's superb leadership and strategy. Every story has a face, it seems. Indeed, this is an ironclad rule in every newsroom. Always on the lookout for the people angle, journalists and their readers take this principle one step further and thus fall prey to the fundamental attribution error. This describes the tendency to overestimate individuals' influence and underestimate external situational factors. In 1967, researchers at Duke University set up the following experiment. Participants read an argument.
-  called out, not of course, vice versa. We may smirk at these stories, but false causality leads us astray practically every day. Consider the headline, employee motivation leads to higher corporate profits. Does it? Maybe people are simply more motivated because the company's doing well. Another headline touts that the more women on a corporate board, the more profitable the firm is. But is that really how it works? Or do highly profitable firms simply tend to recruit more women to their boards? Business book authors and consultants often operate with similar false, or at least fuzzy, causalities.
-  tend to use shampoo XYZ. And perhaps that's because it says, especially for thick hair on the bottle. Recently I read that students get better grades at school if their homes contain a lot of books. This study was surely a shot in the arm for booksellers, but it's another fine example of false causality. The simple truth is that educated parents tend to value their children's education more than uneducated ones do. Plus educated parents often have more books at home. In short, a dust-covered copy of War and Peace alone isn't going to influence anyone's grades. What counts is parents' education levels as well as their genes.
-  Before you decide to take the plunge, look in the mirror and be honest about what you see. 3. Why you see shapes in the clouds. Clustering illusion. In 1957, Swedish opera singer Fredrik JÃ¸rgensson
-  example of false causality was the supposed relationship between the birth rate and the number of stork pairs in Germany. Both were in decline and if you plot them on a graph the two lines of development from 1965 to 1987 appear almost identical. Does this mean the stork actually does bring babies? Obviously not since this was a purely coincidental correlation. In conclusion correlation is not causality. Take a closer look at linked events. Sometimes what's presented as the cause turns out to be the effect and vice versa and sometimes there is no link at all just like with the stork and babies.
-  quality such as beauty, social status, age produces a positive or negative impression that outshines everything else and that the overall effect is disproportionate. Beauty is the best studied example. Dozens of studies have shown that we automatically regard good-looking people as more pleasant, honest, and intelligent. Attractive people also have it easier in their professional lives and that has nothing to do with the myth of women sleeping their way to the top. The effect can even be detected in schools where teachers unconsciously give good-looking students better grades. Advertising has found an ally in the halo effect. Just look at the number of celebrities smiling
-  people is more pleasant, honest, and intelligent. Attractive people also have it easier in their professional lives. And that has nothing to do with the myth of women sleeping their way to the top. The effect can even be detected in schools where teachers unconsciously give good-looking students better grades. Advertising has found an ally in the halo effect. Just look at the number of celebrities smiling at us from TV ads, billboards, and magazines. What makes a professional tennis player like Roger Federer, a coffee machine expert, is still open for debate. But this hasn't detracted from the success of the campaign. We're so used to seeing celebrities promoting arbitrary products that we never stop to consider why their support should be of any importance to us. But this is exactly the sneaky part of the halo effect. It works on a subconscious level. All that needs to register is the attractive face, dream lifestyle, and the

He comments on the interior design and the exquisite landscaping. However, the crucial difference between the two of you remains hidden from view, the risk that lurks behind each of the $10 million. For this, he would need to recognize the alternative path. But not only journalists are underachievers at this skill, we all are. Alternative paths are all the outcomes that could have happened but didn't. With the game of Russian roulette, four alternative paths would have led to the same result, winning the $10 million.
-  Recently I was at a dinner with an American friend who suggested tossing a coin to decide who should pay the bill. He lost. The situation was uncomfortable for me since he was my guest in Switzerland. Next time I'll pay, whether here or in New York, I promised. He thought for a moment and said, considering the alternative paths, you've actually already paid for half of this dinner. In conclusion, risk is not directly visible. Always consider what the alternative paths are. Success that comes about through risky dealings is, to a rational mind, of less worth than success achieved the boring way. For example, with laborious work.
-  directly visible. Therefore, always consider what the alternative paths are. Success that comes about through risky dealings is to a rational mind of less worth than success achieved the boring way. For example, with laborious work as a lawyer, a dentist, a ski instructor, a pilot, a hairdresser, or a consultant. Yes, looking at alternative paths from the outside is a difficult task. Looking at them from the inside an almost impossible task. Your brain will do everything to convince you that your success is warranted, no matter how risky your dealings are, and will obscure any thought of paths other than the one you're on.
-  Number one entertainment platform in three years. Regime shift in North Korea in two years. Sour grapes for France as Argentinian wines expected to dominate. Euro collapse likely. Low cost space flights by 2025. No more crude oil in 15 years. Every day experts bombard us with predictions. But how reliable are they? Until a few years ago, no one bothered to check. Then along came Philip Tetlock. Over a period of 10 years, he evaluated 28,361 predictions from 284 self-appointed professionals. The result? In terms of accuracy, the experts fared only marginally better than a random forecast generator. Ironically, the media darlings were among the poorest performers. And of those, the worst were the prophets
-  with interest. If he's wrong, the money goes to charity. So what is predictable and what is not? Some things are fairly simple. For example, I have a rough idea of how many pounds I will weigh in a year's time. However, the more complex a system and the longer the time frame, the more blurred the view of the future will be. Global warming, oil prices, or exchange rates are almost impossible to foresee. Inventions are not at all predictable because if we knew what technology we would invent in the future, we would already have invented it. So be critical when you encounter predictions. Whenever I hear one, I make sure to smile, no matter how bleak it is. Then I ask myself two questions. First, what incentive does the expert have? If he's an employee, could he lose his job if he's always wrong? Or is he a self-appointed guru who earns a living through books and lectures?
-  following forecast for 1983. Oil consumption will decrease by 30%. Group B heard a dramatic rise in oil prices will lead to a 30% reduction in oil consumption. Both groups had to indicate how likely they considered the scenarios. The result was clear. Group B felt much more strongly about its forecast than Group A did. Kahneman believes that two types of thinking exist. The first kind is intuitive, automatic, and direct. The second is conscious, rational, slow, laborious, and logical. Unfortunately, intuitive thinking draws conclusions long before the conscious mind does. For example, I experienced this after the 9-11 attacks on the World Trade Center. I wanted to take out travel insurance and came across a firm that offered special terrorism cover. Although other policies,
-  I automatically fell for the offer. The high point of the whole farce was that I was willing to pay even more for this enticing yet redundant add-on. In conclusion, forget about left brains and right brains. The difference between intuitive and conscious thinking is much more significant. With important decisions, remember that at the intuitive level, we have a soft spot for plausible stories. Therefore be on the lookout for convenient details and happy endings. Remember, if an additional condition has to be met, no matter how plausible it sounds, it will become less, not more likely.
-  No matter how plausible it sounds, it will become less, not more likely. 42. It's not what you say, but how you say it. Framing. Consider these two statements. Hey, the trash can is full. It would be really great if you could empty the trash, honey. C'est le ton qui fait la musique. It's not what you say, but how you say it. If a message is communicated in different ways, it will also be received in different ways. In psychologist jargon, this technique is called framing.
-  it will also be received in different ways. In psychologist jargon, this technique is called framing. We react differently to identical situations depending on how they're presented. Kahneman and Tversky conducted a survey in the 1980s in which they put forward two options for an epidemic control strategy. The lives of 600 people were at stake, they told participants. Option A saves 200 lives. Option B offers a 33% chance that all 600 people will survive, and a 66% chance that no one will survive. Although options A and B were

Option B offers a 33% chance that all 600 people will survive and a 66% chance that no one will survive. Although options A and B were comparable, with 200 survivors expected, the majority of respondents chose A, remembering the adage, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It became really interesting when the same options were reframed.
-  lives. Option B offers a 33% chance that all 600 people will survive and a 66% chance that no one will survive. Although options A and B were comparable with 200 survivors expected, the majority of respondents chose A, remembering the adage, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It became really interesting when the same options were reframed. Option A kills 400 people. Option B offers a 33% chance that no one will die and a 66% chance that all 600 will die. This time only
-  This time, only a fraction of respondents chose A, and the majority picked B. The researchers observed a complete U-turn from almost all involved. Depending on the phrasing, survive or die, the respondents made completely different decisions. Another example, researchers presented a group of people with two kinds of meat, 99% fat-free and 1% fat, and asked them to choose which was healthier. Can you guess which they picked? Bingo! Respondents ranked the first type of meat as healthier, even though both were identical. Next came the choice between 98% fat-free and 1% fat-free.
-  99% fat free and 1% fat and asked them to choose which was healthier. Can you guess which they picked? Bingo, respondents ranked the first type of meat as healthier, even though both were identical. Next came the choice between 98% fat free and 1% fat. Again, most respondents chose the first option despite its higher fat content. Glossing is a popular type of framing. Under its rules, a tumbling share price becomes a correction. An overpaid acquisition price is branded goodwill. In every management course, a product is considered a product of the highest quality.
-  a war hero. Genocide translates to ethnic cleansing. A successful emergency landing, for example on the Hudson River, is celebrated as a triumph of aviation. Shouldn't a textbook landing on a runway count as an even bigger triumph of aviation? Have you ever looked more closely at the prospectus for financial products, for example ETFs, exchange traded funds? Generally, the brochure illustrates the product's performance in recent years, going back just far enough for the nicest possible upward curve to emerge. This is also framing. Another example is a simple piece of bread.
-  This is also framing. Another example is a simple piece of bread. Depending on how it's framed, as either the symbolic or the true body of Christ, it can split a religion, as happened in the 16th century with the Reformation. Framing is used to good effect in commerce too. Consider used cars. You're led to focus on just a few factors, whether the message is delivered through a salesman, a sign touting certain features, or even your own criteria. For example, if the car has low mileage and good tires, you home in on this and overlook the state of the engine, the brakes, or the interior. Thus, the mileage is not good.
-  Thus, the mileage and tires become the main selling points and frame our decision to buy. Such oversight is only natural, though, since it's difficult to take in all possible pros and cons. Interestingly, had other frames been used to tout the car, we might have decided very differently. Authors are conscious framers, too. A crime novel would be rather dull if, from page one, the murder was shown as it happened, stab by stab, as it were. Even though we eventually discover the motives and murder weapons, the novelist's framing injects thrills and suspense into the story. In conclusion, realize that whatever you communicate contains some element of framing, and that every fact, even if you hear it from a trusted friend or read it in a reputable newspaper, is subject to this effect, too. Even this chapter.
-  friend or read it in a reputable newspaper is subject to this effect too. Even this chapter. 43. Why watching and waiting is torture. Action bias. In a penalty situation in soccer, the ball takes less than 0.3 seconds from the player who kicks the ball to the goal. There's not enough time for the goalkeeper to watch the ball's trajectory. He must make a decision before the ball is kicked. Soccer players who take penalty kicks shoot 1.3 of the time at the middle of the goal, 1.3 of the time at the left, and 1.3 of the time at the right.
-  You must make a decision before the ball is kicked. Soccer players who take penalty kicks shoot one-third of the time at the middle of the goal, one-third of the time at the left, and one-third of the time at the right. Surely goalkeepers have spotted this. But what do they do? They dive either to the left or to the right. Rarely do they stay standing in the middle, even though roughly a third of all balls land there. Why on earth would they jeopardize saving those penalties? The simple answer? Appearance. It looks more impressive and feels less embarrassing to dive to the wrong side than to freeze on the spot and watch the ball sail past.
-  and feels less embarrassing to dive to the wrong side than to freeze on the spot and watch the ball sail past. This is the action bias. Look active even if it achieves nothing. This study comes from the Israeli researcher Michael Bar-Elli who evaluated hundreds of penalty shootouts. But not just goalkeepers fall victim to the action bias. Suppose a group of youths exits a nightclub and begins to argue, shouting at each other and gesturing wildly. The situation is close to escalating into an all-out brawl. The police officers in the area, some young, some more senior, hold back.
-  calming presence of senior officers results in fewer casualties. The action bias is accentuated when a situation is new or unclear. When starting out, many investors act like the young gung-ho police officers outside the nightclub. They can't yet judge the stock market, so they compensate with a sort of hyperactivity. Of course, this is a waste of time. As Charlie Munger sums up his approach to investing, we've got discipline in avoiding just doing any damn thing just because you can't stand inactivity. The action bias exists even in the most educated circles. If a patient's illness can't
-  in avoiding just doing any damn thing just because you can't stand in activity. The action bias exists even in the most educated circles. If a patient's illness can't yet be diagnosed with certainty, and doctors must choose between intervening, namely prescribing something, or waiting and seeing, they're prone to take action. Such decisions have nothing to do with profiteering, but rather with the human tendency to want to do anything but sit and wait in the face of uncertainty. So what accounts for this tendency? In our old hunter-gatherer environment, which suited us quite well, action trumped reflection. Lightning
-  for this tendency. In our old hunter-gatherer environment, which suited us quite well, action trumped reflection. Lightning fast reactions were essential to survival. Deliberation could be fatal. When our ancestors saw a silhouette appear at the edge of the forest, something that looked a lot like a saber-toothed tiger, they didn't take a pew to muse over what it might be. They hit the road and fast. We are the descendants of these quick responders. Back then it was better to run away once too often. However, our world today is different. It rewards reflection, even though our instincts may suggest otherwise.
-  often. However, our world today is different. It rewards reflection, even though our instincts may suggest otherwise. Although we now value contemplation more highly, outright inaction remains a cardinal sin. You get no honor, no medal, no statue with your name on it if you make exactly the right decision by waiting, for the good of the company, the state, even humanity. On the other hand, if you demonstrate decisiveness and quick judgment, and the situation improves, though perhaps coincidentally, it's quite possible your boss or even the mayor will shake your hand.

-  decision by waiting, for the good of the company, the state, even humanity. On the other hand, if you demonstrate decisiveness and quick judgment, and the situation improves, though perhaps coincidentally, it's quite possible your boss or even the mayor will shake your hand. Society at large still prefers rash action to a sensible wait and see strategy. In conclusion, in new or shaky circumstances, we feel compelled to do something, anything. Afterward, we feel better, even if we've made things worse by acting too quickly or too often. So though it might not merit a parade in your honor, if a situation is unclear, hold back until you can assess your options. All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone, wrote Blaise Pascal. At home, in his study.
-  passive option as less horrible. This feeling is called the omission bias. It crops up where both action and inaction lead to cruel consequences. In such cases, we tend to prefer inaction. Its results seem more anodyne. Suppose you're the head of the federal drug administration. You must decide whether or not to approve a drug for the terminally ill. The pills can have fatal side effects. They kill 20% of patients on the spot, but save the lives of the other 80% within a short period of time. What do you decide? Most would withhold approval. To them, waving through a drug that takes out every fifth person is a worse act than failing to administer the cure to the other 80% of patients. It's an absurd decision and a perfect example of a bad decision.
-  person is a worse act than failing to administer the cure to the other 80% of patients. It's an absurd decision and a perfect example of the omission bias. Suppose that you're aware of the bias and decide to approve the drug in the name of reason and decency. Bravo! But what happens when the first patient dies? A media storm ensues, and soon you find yourself out of a job. As a civil servant or a politician, you'd do well to take the ubiquitous omission bias seriously and even foster it. Case law shows how ingrained such moral distortion is in our society. Active euthanasia
-  As a civil servant or a politician, you'd do well to take the ubiquitous omission bias seriously, and even foster it. Case law shows how ingrained such moral distortion is in our society. Active euthanasia, even if it's the explicit wish of the dying, is punishable by law, whereas deliberate refusal of life-saving measures is legal, for example, following so-called DNR orders, do not resuscitate. Such thinking also explains why parents feel it's perfectly acceptable not to vaccinate their children, even though it discernibly reduces the risk of catching the disease. Of course, there's also a very small risk of getting sick from the vaccine. Overall, however, vaccination makes sense. Vaccination protects not only the children, but society, too. A person who is immune to the disease will never infect a person.
-  Of course, there's also a very small risk of getting sick from the vaccine. Overall, however, vaccination makes sense. Vaccination protects not only the children, but society, too. A person who is immune to the disease will never infect others. Objectively, if non-vaccinated children ever contracted one of these sicknesses, we could accuse the parents of actively harming them. But this is exactly the point. Deliberate inaction somehow seems less grave than a comparable action, say, if the parents intentionally infected them. The omission bias lies behind the following delusions. We wait until people shoot themselves in the face.
-  But inaction somehow seems less grave than a comparable action, say if the parents intentionally infected them. The omission bias lies behind the following delusions. We wait until people shoot themselves in the foot rather than taking aim ourselves. Investors and business journalists are more lenient on companies that develop no new products than they are on those that produce bad ones, even though both roads lead to ruin. Getting passively on a bunch of miserable shares feels better than actively buying bad ones. Building no emission filter into a coal plant feels superior to removing one for cost reasons. Failing to invest in a company that produces bad products is a bad thing. It's a bad thing. It's a bad thing. It's a bad thing. It's a bad thing. It's a bad thing. It's a bad thing. It's a bad thing.

-  bad ones. Building no emission filter into a coal plant feels superior to removing one for cost reasons. Failing to insulate your house is more acceptable than burning the spared fuel for your own amusement. Neglecting to declare income tax is less immoral than faking tax documents, even though the state loses out either way. In the previous chapter, we met the action bias. Is it the opposite of the omission bias? Quite. The action bias causes us to offset a lack of clarity with futile hyperactivity and comes into play when a situation is fuzzy, muddy, or contradictory.

The action bias causes us to offset a lack of clarity with futile hyperactivity and comes into play when a situation is fuzzy, muddy, or contradictory. The omission bias, on the other hand, usually abounds where the situation is intelligible. A future misfortune might be averted with direct action, but this insight doesn't motivate us as much as it should. The omission bias is very difficult to detect. After all, action is more noticeable than inaction. In the 1960s, student movements coined a punchy slogan to condemn it. If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.
-  going to punchy slogan to condemn it. If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. 45, don't blame me, self-serving bias. Do you ever read annual reports paying particular attention to the CEO's comments? No, that's a pity because there you'll find countless examples of this next error, which we all fall for at one time or another. For example, if the company has enjoyed an excellent year, the CEO catalogs his indispensable contributions, his brilliant decisions, tireless efforts, and cultivating his own business.
-  For example, if the company has enjoyed an excellent year, the CEO catalogs his indispensable contributions, his brilliant decisions, tireless efforts, and cultivation of a dynamic corporate culture. However, if the company has had a miserable year, we read about all sorts of other dynamics â the unfortunate exchange rate, governmental interference, the malicious trade practices of the Chinese, various hidden tariffs, subdued consumer confidence, and so on. In short, we attribute success to ourselves and failures to external factors. This is the self-serving bias. Even if you've never heard the expression,
-  But if it disappears in the flood of new releases, it's because the readers simply don't recognize good literature when they see it. And if the critics slay it, it's clearly a case of jealousy. To investigate this bias, researchers put together a personality test and afterward allocated the participants good or bad scores at random. Those who got scored highly found the test thorough and fair. Low scorers rated it completely useless. So why do we attribute success to our own skill and ascribe failure to other factors? There are many theories. The simplest explanation is probably this. It feels good. Plus it doesn't cause any major harm. If it did, evolution would have eliminated it over the past 100,000 years. But beware, in a modern world with many hidden risks, the self-serving bias can quickly lead to catastrophe.
-  a year later, they tend to boost their scores by around 50 points. Interestingly, they're neither lying nor exaggerating, they're simply enhancing the result a little, until they start to believe the new score themselves. In the building where I live, five students share an apartment. I meet them now and again in the elevator and I decided to ask them separately how often they take out the trash. One said he did it every second time, another every third time. And then, night number three, cursing because his garbage bag had split, reckoned he did it pretty much every time, say 90%. Although their answers should have added up to 100%, these boys achieved an impressive 320%. The five systematically overestimated their roles, and so are no different from any of us. In married couples, the same thing happens. It's been shown to be true.
-  The five systematically overestimated their roles, and so are no different from any of us. In married couples, the same thing happens. It's been shown that both men and women overestimate their contribution to the health of the marriage. Each assumes their input is more than 50%. So how can we dodge the self-serving bias? Do you have friends who tell you the truth, no holds barred? If so, consider yourself lucky. If not, do you have at least one enemy? Good. Invite him or her over for coffee, and ask for an honest opinion about your strengths and weaknesses. You'll be forever grateful you did.

Suppose one day the phone rings and excited voice tells you that you've just scooped the lottery jackpot, ten million dollars. How would you feel and how long would you feel like that? Another scenario the phone rings and you learn that your best friend has passed away Again, how would you feel and for how long? in chapter 40 false prophets
-  in the fields of politics, economics, and social events. We concluded that self-appointed experts are of no more use than a random forecast generator. So moving on to a new area, how well can we predict our feelings? Are we experts on ourselves? Would winning the lottery make us the happiest people alive for years to come? Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says no. He studied lottery winners and discovered that the happiness effect fizzles out after a few months. So a little while after you receive the big check, you'll be as content or as discontent as you were before. He calls this effective forecast.
-  After you receive the big check, you'll be as content or as discontent as you were before. He calls this effective forecasting, our inability to correctly predict our own emotions. A friend, a banking executive, whose enormous income was beginning to burn a hole in his pocket, decided to build himself a new home away from the city. His dream materialized into a villa with 10 rooms, a swimming pool, and an enviable view of the lake and mountains. For the first few weeks, he beamed with delight. But soon the cheerfulness disappeared, and six months later he was unhappier than ever. What happened?
-  presents a major source of discontent and stress, and people hardly ever get used to it. In other words, whoever has no innate affinity for commuting will suffer every day, twice a day. Anyhow, the moral of the story is that the dream villa had an overall negative effect on my friend's happiness. Many others fare no better. People who change or progress in their careers are, in terms of happiness, right back where they started after around three months. The same goes for people who buy the latest Porsche. Science calls this effect the hedonic treadmill. We work hard, advance, and are able to afford more and nicer things, and yet this
-  We work hard, advance, and are able to afford more and nicer things, and yet this doesn't make us any happier. So how do negative events affect us? Perhaps a spinal cord injury, or the loss of a friend? Here, we also overestimate the duration and intensity of future emotions. For example, when a relationship ends, it feels like life will never be the same. The afflicted are completely convinced that they'll never again experience joy. But after three or so months, they're back on the dating scene. Wouldn't it be nice if we knew exactly how happy a new car, career, or relationship would make us?
-  to make better, brighter decisions. A, avoid negative things that you cannot grow accustomed to, such as commuting, noise, or chronic stress. B, expect only short-term happiness from material things, such as cars, houses, lottery winnings, bonuses, and prizes. C, aim for as much free time and autonomy as possible, since long-lasting positive effects generally come from what you actively do. Follow your passions, even if you must forfeit a portion of your income for them. Invest in friendships. For most people, professional status achieves long-lasting happiness, as long as they don't change peer groups at the same time. In other words, if you ascend to a CEO role and fraternize only with other executives, the effect fizzles out.
-  The effect fizzles out. 47. Do not marvel at your existence. Self-selection bias. Travelling from Philadelphia up to New York, I got stuck in a traffic jam. Why is it always me? I groaned. Glancing to the opposite side of the road, I saw carefree southbound drivers racing past with enviable speed. As I spent the next hour crawling forward at a snail's pace and started to grow restless from braking and accelerating, I asked myself whether I really was especially unlucky. Do I always pick the worst line to drive?
-  forward at a snail's pace and started to grow restless from breaking and accelerating, I asked myself whether I really was especially unlucky. Do I always pick the worst lines at the bank, post office and grocery store? Or do I just think I do? Suppose that on this highway, a traffic jam develops 10% of the time. The probability that I'll get stuck in a jam on a particular day is not greater than the probability that one will occur. However, the likelihood that I will get stuck at a certain point in my journey is greater than 10%. The reason? Because I can only crawl forward when in a traffic jam, I spend a disproportionate amount
-  and the others green. However, you may spend more than 10% of your total travel time waiting at a red light. If this doesn't seem right, imagine that you're traveling at near the speed of light. In this case, you'd spend 99.99%, not 10% of your total journey time waiting and cursing in front of red traffic lights. Whenever we complain about bad luck, we must be wary of the so-called self- selection bias. My male friends often gripe about there being too few women in their companies, and my female friends groan that theirs have too few men. This has nothing to do with bad luck. The grumblers form part of the sample. The problem

The self-selection bias is pervasive. Marketers sometimes stumble into the trap in this way. To analyze how much customers value their newsletter they send out a questionnaire. Unfortunately this reaches only one group. Current subscribers who are clearly satisfied have time to respond and have not canceled their subscriptions. The others make up no part of the sample. Result? The poll is worthless. Not too long ago a rather

Kevin has presented his division's results to the company's board on three different occasions. Each time, things have gone perfectly. And each time, he's worn his green polka dot boxer shorts. It's official, he thinks. These are my lucky underpants. The girl in the jewelry store was so stunning that Kevin couldn't help buying the $10,000 engagement ring she showed.

Since then, he's always felt uncomfortable on very warm days. If the temperature starts to heat up around one of his checkups, he cancels right away. Our brain is a connection machine. This is quite practical. If we eat an unknown fruit and feel sick afterward, we avoid it in the future, labeling the plant poisonous or at least unpalatable. This is how knowledge comes to be. However, this method also creates false knowledge.
-  sick afterward we avoided in the future, labeling the plant poisonous or at least unpalatable. This is how knowledge comes to be. However, this method also creates false knowledge. Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov was the first to conduct research into this phenomenon. His original goal was to measure salivation in dogs. He used a bell to call the dogs to eat. But soon the ringing sound was enough to make the dogs salivate. The animal's brains linked two functionally unrelated things, the ringing of a bell and the production of saliva. Pavlov's method works equally well with humans. Advertising creates a link between products.

Advertising creates a link between products and emotions. For this reason, you'll never see a coke alongside a frowning face or a wrinkly body. Coke people are young, beautiful and oh so fun and they appear in clusters not seen in the real world. These false connections are the work of the association bias, which also influences the quality of our decisions. For example,
-  bias, which also influences the quality of our decisions. For example, we often condemn bearers of bad news since we automatically associate them with the message's content, otherwise known as shoot the messenger syndrome. Sometimes CEOs and investors unconsciously steer clear of these harbingers, meaning the only news that reaches the upper echelons is positive, thus creating a distorted view of the real situation. If you lead a group of people and don't want to fall prey to false connections, direct your staff to tell you only the bad news, and fast. With this, you overcompensate for the shoot the messenger syndrome, and believe me, you will still hear enough positive news. In the days before email and telemarketing, traveling salesmen went door to door peddling their wares. One day, a particular salesman, George Foster, stood at a front desk.
-  his fear of ringing doorbells had become so strong that he couldn't carry out his job for many years. He knew how unlikely a repeat of the incident was, but for all he tried he just couldn't manage to reverse the false emotional connection. The take-home message from all this is phrased most aptly by Mark Twain, we should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again and that as well, but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.
-  again and that as well but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore. 49. Be wary when things get off to a great start. Beginner's luck. In the last chapter we learned about the association bias, the tendency to see connections where none exist. For example, regardless of how many big presentations he's nailed while wearing them, Kevin's green polka dot underpants are no guarantee of success. We now come to a particularly tricky branch of the association bias, creating a false link with the past.

They call it beginners luck People who are new to a game and lose in the first few rounds are usually clever enough to fold But whoever strikes it lucky tends to keep going Convinced of their above-average skills these amateurs increase the stakes But they soon will get a sobering wake-up call when the probabilities normalize Beginners luck plays an important role in the economy say company a
-  and the probabilities normalize. Beginner's luck plays an important role in the economy. Say company A buys smaller companies, B, C, and D, one after the other. The acquisitions prove a success, and the directors believe they have real skill for acquisitions. Boyed by this confidence, they now buy a much larger company, E. The integration is a disaster. The merger proves too difficult to handle. The estimated synergy is impossible to realize. Objectively speaking, this was foreseeable because in the previous acquisitions, everything fell perfectly into place as if guided by a magical hand. So beginner's luck is a disaster.
-  to realize. Objectively speaking, this was foreseeable because in the previous acquisitions everything fell perfectly into place as if guided by a magical hand. So beginner's luck blinded them. The same goes for the stock exchange. Driven by initial success, many investors pumped their life savings into Internet stocks in the late 90s. Some even took out loans to capitalize on the opportunity. However, these investors overlooked one tiny detail. Their amazing profits at the time had nothing to do with their stock picking abilities. The market was simply on an upward spiral. Even the most clueless investors won big. When the market
-  without the previous victories in smaller battles to bolster them. But how do you tell the difference between beginner's luck and the first signs of real talent? There is no clear rule, but these two tips may help. First, if you're much better than others over a long period of time, you can be fairly sure that talent plays a part. Unfortunately, you can never be 100% sure, though. Second, the more people competing, the greater the chances are that one of them will repeatedly strike lucky. Perhaps even you. If among 10 competitors you establish yourself as a market leader over many years, you can clap yourself on the back. That's a sure indication of your luck.
-  lucky. Perhaps even you. If among 10 competitors you establish yourself as a market leader over many years, you can clap yourself on the back. That's a sure indication of talent. But if you're top dog among 10 million players, namely in the financial markets, you shouldn't start visualizing a Buffett-esque financial empire just yet. It's extremely likely that you have simply been very fortunate. Watch and wait before you draw any conclusions. Beginner's luck can be devastating, so guard against misconceptions by treating your theories as a scientist would. Try to disprove them. As my first novel, 35, was ready to go,

He placed his front paws against the trunk of the vine, stretched his neck, and tried to get at the fruit, but it was too high. Irritated, he tried his luck again. He launched himself upward, but his jaw snapped only at fresh air. A third time he leapt with all his might, so powerfully as to get to the top.
-  But it was too high. Irritated, he tried his luck again. He launched himself upward, but his jaw snapped only at fresh air. A third time he leapt with all his might, so powerfully that he landed back down on the ground with a thud. Still, not a single leaf had stirred. The fox turned up his nose. These aren't even ripe yet. Why would I want sour grapes? Holding his head high, he strode back into the forest. The Greek poet Aesop created this fable to illustrate one of the most common errors in reasoning. An inconsistency arose when the fox set out to do something and failed to accomplish it.
-  He launched himself upward, but his jaw snapped only at fresh air. A third time he leapt with all his might, so powerfully that he landed back down on the ground with a thud. Still not a single leaf had stirred. The fox turned up his nose. These aren't even ripe yet. Why would I want sour grapes? Holding his head high, he strode back into the forest. The Greek poet Aesop created this fable to illustrate one of the most common errors in functioning. An inconsistency arose when the fox set out to do something and failed to accomplish it. He can resolve this conflict in one of three ways. A. By somehow getting at the grapes. B. By admitting that his skills are insufficient. Or C. By reinterpreting what happened retrospectively. This last option is an example of cognitive dissonance, or rather, its resolution.
-  is an example of cognitive dissonance, or rather, its resolution. Suppose you buy a new car. However, you regret your choice soon afterward. The engine sounds like a jet taking off, and you just can't get comfortable in the driver's seat. What do you do? Giving the car back would be an admission of error. You don't want that. And anyway, the dealer probably wouldn't refund all the money. So, you tell yourself that a loud engine and awkward seats are great safety features that will prevent you from falling asleep at the wheel. Not so stupid after all, you think, and you're suddenly proud of your sound, practical purchase.
-  the situation, so did they. The students who received more didn't have to justify anything. They had lied and netted $20 for it. A fair deal. They experienced no cognitive dissonance. Suppose you apply for a job and discover you've lost out to another candidate. Instead of admitting that the other person was better suited, you convince yourself that you didn't want the job in the first place. You simply wanted to test your market value and see if you could get invited for an interview. I reacted very similarly some time ago when I had to choose between investing in two different stocks. My chosen stock lost much of its value shortly after the purchase, whereas shares in the other stock, the one I hadn't invested in, skyrocketed. I couldn't bring myself to admit my error. Quite the reverse, in fact. I distinctly remember trying to convince a friend that, though the stock was experiencing tea,
-  What do you do? You probably leave a tip as well. Social proof, sometimes roughly termed the herd instinct, dictates that individuals feel they're behaving correctly when they act the same as other people. In other words, the more people who follow a certain idea, the better or truer we deem the idea to be. And the more people who display a certain behavior, the more appropriate this behavior is judged by others. This is, of course, absurd. Social proof is the evil behind bubbles and stock market panic. It exists in fashion, management techniques, hobbies, religion, and diets. It can paralyze whole cultures, such as when sex commit collective suicide. A simple experiment carried out in the 1950s by legendary
-  interest rates, banks charge on credit card debt, and other short-term personal loans, both of which exploit our must-have-now instincts. In conclusion, though instantaneous reward is incredibly tempting, hyperbolic discounting is still a flaw. The more power we gain over our impulses, the better we can avoid this trap. The less power we have over our impulses, for example, when we're under the influence of alcohol, the more susceptible we are. From the other side, if you sell consumer products, give customers the option of getting their hands on the items right away. Some people will be willing to pay extra just so they don't have to wait. Amazon makes a bundle from this.

-  Strangely enough, my level of frustration was much lower this time. Why? Reassuringly cheerful signs along the road announced, we're renovating the highway for you. The jam reminded me of an experiment conducted by the Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer in the 1970s. For this, she went into a library and waited at a photocopier until a line had formed. Then she approached the first in line and said, excuse me, I have found a way to get to the library. Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine? Her success rate was 60%. She repeated the experiment, this time giving a reason. Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I'm in a rush? In almost all cases, 94%, she was allowed to go ahead. This is understandable. If people are in a hurry, you often let them cut into the front of the line.
-  yet another approach, this time saying, excuse me, I have five pages, may I go before you because I have to make some copies? The result was amazing, even though the pretext was, ahem, paper thin, after all, everyone was standing in line to make copies, she was allowed to pass to the front of the line in almost all cases, 93%. When you justify your behavior, you encounter more tolerance and helpfulness. It seems to matter very little if your excuse is good or not. Using the simple validation, because, is sufficient. A sign proclaiming, we're renovating the highway for you, is completely redundant.
-  The word greases the wheels of human interaction. Use it unrestrainedly. 53. Decide better, decide less. Decision fatigue. For weeks, you've been working to the point of exhaustion on this presentation. The PowerPoint slides are polished. Each figure in Excel is indisputable. The pitch is a paradigm of crystal clear logic. Everything depends on your presentation. If you get the green light from the CEO, you're on your way to a corner office. If the presentation flops, you're on your way to the unemployment office.
-  presentation flops, you're on your way to the unemployment office. The CEO's assistant proposes the following times for the presentation 8 a.m., 1130 a.m., or 6 p.m. Which slot do you choose? The psychologist Roy Baumeister and collaborator Gene Twenke once covered a table with hundreds of inexpensive items from tennis balls and candles to t-shirts chewing gum and coke cans. He divided his students into two groups. The first group he labeled deciders, the second nondeciders. He told the first group, I'm going to show you sets containing two random items and each time you have to decide which you prefer. At the end of the experiment I'll give you one item you can take home. They were led to believe that their choices would influence them which item they get to keep. To the second group he said, write down what you think about each item and I'll
-  they get to keep. To the second group he said, write down what you think about each item and I'll pick one and give it to you at the end. Immediately thereafter he asked each student to put their hand in ice cold water and hold it there as long as possible. In psychology, this is a classic method to measure willpower or self-discipline. If you have little or none, you yank your hand back out of the water very quickly. The result? The deciders pulled their hands out of the icy water much sooner than the non-deciders did. The intensive decision-making had drained their willpower, an effect confirmed in many other experiments. Making decisions is exhausting. Anyone
-  you yank your hand back out of the water very quickly. The result? The deciders pulled their hands out of the icy water much sooner than the non-deciders did. The intensive decision-making had drained their willpower, an effect confirmed in many other experiments. Making decisions is exhausting. Anyone who has ever configured a laptop online or researched a long trip flight, hotels, activities, restaurants, weather, knows this well. After all the comparing, considering and choosing, you're exhausted. Science calls this decision fatigue. Decision fatigue is perilous. As a consumer you become more susceptible to advertising.

How did the judges decide? More significant than the detainee's allegiance or the severity of their crimes was the judge's decision fatigue. The judges granted requests one and two because their blood sugar was still high from breakfast or lunch. However, they struck out applications three and four because they couldn't summon enough energy to risk the consequences of an early release. They took option.
-  from breakfast or lunch. However, they struck out applications three and four because they couldn't summon enough energy to risk the consequences of an early release. They took the easy option, the status quo, and the men remained in jail. A study of hundreds of verdicts shows that within a session, the percentage of courageous judicial decisions gradually drops from 65% to almost zero, and after a recess, returns to 65%. So much for the careful deliberations of Lady Justice. But as long as you have no upcoming trials, all is not lost. You now know when to present your project to the CEO.
-  Breathing, I asked, about a billion per breath. His cough got even worse. 55, why there is no such thing as an average war? The problem with averages. Suppose you're on a bus with 49 other people. At the next stop, the heaviest person in America gets on. Question, by how much has the average weight of the passengers increased? 4%, 5%, something like that? Suppose the bus stops again and on gets Bill Gates. This time we're not concerned about weight. Question.
-  The average wealth has just shot up to $1.15 billion, an increase of more than 2 million percent. A single outlier has radically altered the picture, rendering the term average completely meaningless. Don't cross a river if it is, on average, four feet deep, warns Nassim Taleb, from whom I have the above examples. The river can be very shallow for long distances, and the river can be very shallow for long distances. It can be very shallow for long stretches, mere inches, but it might transform into a raging torrent that's 20 feet deep in the middle, in which case you could easily drown.
-  gather her friends and suddenly they all bolted. What would you have done? Would you have stayed put scratching your head and weighing up whether what you were looking at was a lion or something that just looked like a lion but was in fact a harmless animal that could serve as a great protein source? No, you would have sprinted after your friends. Later on when you were safe you could have reflected on what had actually happened. Those who acted differently and I'm sure there were some exited the gene pool. We are the direct heirs of those who copied the other's behavior. This pattern is so deeply rooted in us that we still use it today even when it offers no survival advantage. Only a few cases come to mind where social proof is of value. For example if you find
-  in a darkened office, then fly to Barbados and lie in the sun without sunscreen for a week solid, you'd have a problem. Even though on average over the summer, you were not getting more UV light than someone who was regularly outside. All this is quite straightforward and maybe you were aware of it already. For example, you drink one glass of red wine for dinner every evening. That's not a health issue. Many doctors recommend it. But if you drink no alcohol the entire year and on December 31st you gulp 356 glasses, which is equivalent to 60 bottles, you will have a problem. Although the average over the year is the same.
-  countless other pages draw comparatively few. In such cases, mathematicians speak of the so-called Power Law. Take cities. There is one city on this planet with a population of more than 30 million, Tokyo. There are 11 cities with a population of between 20 and 30 million. There are 15 cities with a population of between 10 and 20 million. There are 48 cities between 5 and 10 million inhabitants, and thousands between 1 and 5 million. That's a Power Law. A few extremes dominate the distribution, and the concept of average is rendered worthless. What's the answer?
-  What's the average book sell? What's the average amount of damage a hurricane wreaks? What's a banker's average bonus? What's the average success of a marketing campaign? How many downloads does an average iPhone app get? How much money does an average actor earn? Of course you can calculate the answers, but it would be a waste of time. These seemingly routine scenarios are subject to the power law. To use just the final example, a handful of actors take home more than $10 million per year, while thousands and thousands live on the breadline. Would you advise your son or daughter to get into acting since the average wage is pretty decent? Hopefully not.
-  The future is already here. It's just not very evenly distributed. 56. How bonuses destroy motivation. Motivation crowding. A few months ago, a friend from Connecticut decided to move to New York City. This man had a fabulous collection of antiques, such as exquisite old books and hand-blown Murano glasses from generations ago. I knew how attached he was to them, and how anxious he would be handing them over to a moving company. So the last time I visited, I offered to carry the most fragile items with me when I went to New York.
-  radioactive waste. The authorities considered a few different locations for the underground repository, including the village of Wolfenscheisen in the center of the country. Economist Bruno Frey and his fellow researchers at the University of Zurich traveled there and recorded people's opinions at a community meeting. Surprisingly, 50.8% were in favor of the proposal. Their positive response can be attributed to several factors. National pride, common decency, social obligation, the prospect of new jobs, and so on. The team carried out the survey a second time, but this time they mentioned a hypothetical reward of $5,000 for each town person paid for by Swiss taxpayers if they were to accept the proposal. What happened? Results plummeted. Only 24.6%
-  And they mentioned a hypothetical reward of $5,000 for each town person paid for by Swiss taxpayers if they were to accept the proposal. What happened? Results plummeted. Only 24.6% were willing to endorse the proposal. Another example is children's daycare centers. Daycare workers face the same issue the world over. Parents collecting their children after closing time. The staff has no choice but to wait. They can hardly put the last remaining children in taxis or leave them on the curb. To discourage parental tardiness, many nurseries introduced fees for lateness. Ironically, studies showed that tardiness actually increased. Of course, they could have instituted a draconian penalty of, say, $500 for each hour, as they could have offered $1 million to each citizen of the small Swiss village. But that's beside the point.
-  others behavior. This pattern is so deeply rooted in us that we still use it today, even when it offers no survival advantage. Only a few cases come to mind where social proof is of value. For example, if you find yourself hungry in a foreign city and don't know a good restaurant, it makes sense to pick the one that's full of locals. In other words, you copy the locals behavior. Comedy and talk shows make use of social proof by inserting canned laughter at strategic spots inciting the audience to laugh along. One of the most impressive, though troubling, cases of this phenomenon is the famous speech by Nazi propaganda minister
-  in penalty of, say, $500 for each hour, as they could have offered $1 million to each citizen of the small Swiss village. But that's beside the point. The point is, small, surprisingly small monetary incentives crowd out other types of incentives. The three stories illustrate one thing. Money does not always motivate. Indeed, in many cases, it does just the opposite. When my friend slit me that 50, he undermined my good deed and also tainted our friendship. The offer of compensation for the nuclear repository was perceived as a bribe and cheapened the community in patriotic spirit. The nursery's late fees transformed its relationship with parents from interpersonal to monetary and essentially legitimized their lateness. Science has a name for this phenomenon, motivation crowding.

-  name for this phenomenon, motivation crowding. When people do something for well-meaning non-monetary reasons, out of the goodness of their hearts so to speak, payments throw a wrench into the works. Financial reward erodes any other motivations. Suppose you run a nonprofit organization. Logically the wages you pay are quite modest. Nevertheless your employees are highly motivated because they believe they're making a difference. If you suddenly introduce a bonus system let's say a small salary increase for every donation secured, motivation crowding will commence. Your team will begin to snub tasks that bring no extra reward. Creativity, company reputation, knowledge transfer, none of this will matter anymore. Soon all efforts will zoom in on attracting donations. So who is safe from motivation crowding?
-  begin to snub tasks that bring no extra reward. Creativity, company reputation, knowledge transfer, none of this will matter anymore. Soon all efforts will zoom in on attracting donations. So who is safe from motivation crowding? This tip should help. Do you know any private bankers, insurance agents, or financial auditors who do their jobs out of passion, or who believe in a higher mission? I don't. Financial incentives and performance bonuses work well in industries with generally uninspiring jobs. Industries where employees aren't proud of the products or the companies and do the work simply because they get a paycheck. On the other hand, if you create a startup, you would be wise to enlist employee enthusiasm to promote the company's endeavor, rather than just a simple job.
-  they get a paycheck. On the other hand, if you create a startup, you would be wise to enlist employee enthusiasm to promote the company's endeavor, rather than try to entice employees with juicy bonuses, which you couldn't pay anyway. One final tip for those of you who have children. Experience shows that young people are not for sale. If you want your kids to do their homework, practice musical instruments, or even mow the lawn once in a while, don't reach for your wallet. Instead, give them a fixed amount of pocket money each week. Otherwise, they'll exploit the system and soon refuse to go to bed without recompense.

When asked why a fifth of Americans were unable to locate their country on a world map, Miss Teen South Carolina, a high school graduate, gave this answer in front of rolling cameras. I personally believe that US Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have maps and I believe that our education
-  Say nothing. Simplicity is the zenith of a long, arduous journey, not the starting point. 58. How to increase the average IQ of two states. Will Rogers Phenomenon Let's say you run a small private bank. The bank manages the money of wealthy and mostly retired individuals. Two money managers, A and B, report to you. Money manager A manages the money of a few ultra-high net worth individuals. Money manager B has rich but not extravagantly rich clients to deal with. The board asks you to increase the average pool of money of both A and B within six months. If you succeed, you receive a handsome bonus. If not, they'll find someone else to do it. Where do you start?
-  within six months. If you succeed, you receive a handsome bonus. If not, they'll find someone else to do it. Where do you start? It's quite simple actually. You take a client with a sizable but not a huge pool of money from A and give it to B instead. In one fell swoop, this brings up A's average managed wealth as well as B's without you having to find a single new client. The only remaining question is, how will you spend your bonus? Suppose you switch careers and are now in charge of three hedge funds that invest primarily in privately held companies. Fund A has sensational returns. Fund B's are mediocre and fund C's are miserable. You want to prove yourself to the world, so what's your master plan? You know how it works now. You move a few of A's shares to
-  returns. Fund Bs are mediocre and fund Cs are miserable. You want to prove yourself to the world, so what's your master plan? You know how it works now. You move a few of A's shares to B and C, picking exactly those investments that have been pulling down A's average returns, but which are still profitable enough to fortify B and C. In no time all three funds look much healthier and because the transformation happened in-house, you don't incur a single fee. Of course the combined value of the trio hasn't risen by a single cent, but people will still pat you on the back.

Of course, the combined value of the trio hasn't risen by a single cent, but people will still pat you on the back. This effect is called stage migration, or the Will Rogers phenomenon, named after an American comedian from Oklahoma. He is said to have joked that Oklahomans who pack up and move to California raise both states average IQ. Since we rarely recognize such scenarios, let's drill the Will Rogers phenomenon to anchor it in your memory.
-  anonymously, it's likely that nobody would have consented to this crazy proposal. The advertising industry benefits greatly from our weakness for social proof. This works well when a situation is unclear, such as deciding among various car-makes, cleaning products, beauty products, and so on, with no obvious advantages or disadvantages, and where people like you and me appear. So be skeptical whenever a company claims its product is better because it's the most popular. How is a product better? Simply because it sells the most units. And remember English novelist W. Somerset Maugham's wise words,
-  rising averages in countries, companies, departments, cost centers, or product lines. A particularly deceitful case of the Will Rogers phenomenon is found in medicine. Tumors are usually broken down in four stages. The smallest and most treatable ones are classified as stage one. The worst are rated stage four. Their progression gives us the term stage migration. The survival rate is highest for stage one patients and lowest for stage four patients. Now every year new procedures are released under the market and allow for more accurate diagnosis. These new screening techniques reveal minuscule tumors that no doctor had ever noticed before. The result? Patients who were erroneously diagnosed as healthy before are now counted as stage one patients. The addition of relatively healthy people into the stage one group increases the chance

These new screening techniques reveal minuscule tumors that no doctor had ever noticed before. The result?

The addition of relatively healthy people into the stage 1 group increases the group's average life expectancy. A great medical success? Unfortunately not. Mere stage migration.

In his short story, Del Rigor en la Ciencia, which consists of just a single paragraph, Jorge Luis Borges describes a special country. In this country, the science of cartography is so sophisticated that only the most detailed of maps will do. That is, a map with a scale of one to one, as large as the country itself. Their citizens soon realize that such a map does not provide any insight, since it merely duplicates what they already know. Borges' map is the extreme case of a map that is not a map.
-  While in Miami, a little while ago, I drew up a short list of five good offers. Right away, one jumped out at me. But I wanted to make sure I had found the best deal and decided to keep researching. I plowed my way through dozens of customer reviews and blog posts and clicked through countless photos and videos. Two hours later, I could say for sure which the best hotel was. The one I had liked at the start. The mountain of additional information did not lead to a better decision. On the contrary, if time is money, then I might as well have taken up residence at the Four Seasons. John Barron from the University of Pennsylvania
-  the one I had liked at the start. The mountain of additional information did not lead to a better decision. On the contrary, if time is money, then I might as well have taken up residence at the Four Seasons. John Barron from the University of Pennsylvania asked physicians the following question. A patient presents symptoms that indicate with a probability of 80% that he is suffering from disease A. If this is not the case, the patient has either disease X or Y. Each of these diseases is equally bad, and each treatment results in similar side effects. As a doctor, what treatment would you suggest? Logically, you would opt for disease A and recommend the relevant therapy. Now suppose there is a diagnostic test that flashes positive when disease X is present and negative when disease Y is detected.
-  equally bad and each treatment results in similar side effects. As a doctor, what treatment would you suggest? Logically you would opt for disease A and recommend the relevant therapy. Now suppose there is a diagnostic test that flashes positive when disease X is present and negative when disease Y is detected. However, if the patient really does have disease A, the test results will be positive in 50% of the cases and negative in the other 50%. Would you recommend conducting the test? Most doctors said yes, even though the results would be irrelevant. Assuming that the test result is positive, the probability of disease A is still much greater than that of disease X. The additional information contributes nothing of value to the decision. Doctors are not the only professionals with a pension for surplus information.
-  W. Somerset Mom's wise words. If 50 million people say something foolish, it's still foolish. 5. Why you should forget the past. Sunk cost fallacy.
-  Every weekend and holiday went into getting it up and running. All the while his marriage was approaching breakdown. It was a struggle, but finally Mark's prized possession was road ready and gleamed in the sunshine. Two years later, Mark desperately needs money. He sells all his possessions, the TV, the car, even his house, but not the bike. Even when a prospect offers double the actual value, Mark does not sell it. John and Mark are victims of effort justification. When you put a lot of energy into a task, you tend to overvalue the result. Because John had to endure physical pain for the parachute pin, it outshines all his other rewards. And since Mark's Harley cost him so many hours, and also nearly his wife, he prizes the bike so highly that he will never sell it.
-  it outshines all his other rewards. And since Mark's Harley cost him so many hours, and also nearly his wife, he prizes the bike so highly that he will never sell it. Effort justification is a special case of cognitive dissonance. To have a hole punched in your chest for a simple merit badge borders on the absurd. John's brain compensates for this imbalance by overvaluing the pin, hyping it up from something mundane to something semi-sacred. All of this happens unconsciously and is difficult to prevent. Groups use effort justification to bind members to them. For example, through initiation rites.
-  on, once the students have the MBAs in the bag, they'll deem the qualification essential for their careers simply because it demanded so much of them. A mild form of effort justification is the so-called IKEA effect. Furniture that we assemble ourselves seems more valuable than any expensive designer piece. The same goes for hand-knitted socks. To throw away a handcrafted pair, even if they're tatty and outdated, is hard to do. Managers who put weeks of hard work into a strategy proposal will be incapable of appraising it objectively. Designers, copywriters, product developers, or any other professionals who brood over their creations are similarly guilty of this. In the 50s, instant cake mixes were introduced to the market. A surefire hit, thought the manufacturers. Far from it. Housewives took in
-  disliking to them because they made things too easy. The firms reacted and made the preparation slightly more difficult beating in an egg yourself. The added effort raised the ladies sense of achievement and with it their appreciation for convenience food. Now that you know about effort justification you can rate your projects more objectively. Try it out. When you've invested a lot of time and effort into something stand back and examine the result only the result. The novel you've been tinkering with for five years and that no publisher wants perhaps it's not Nobel worthy after all. The MBA you felt compelled to do.
-  you've been chasing for years. Is she really better than Bachelorette number 2, who would say yes right away? You sit on the corporate board of a retail company with 1,000 stores. Half of the stores are in cities, the other half in rural areas. At the behest of the CEO, a consultant conducted a study on shoplifting and is now presenting his findings. Projected onto the wall in front are the names of the 100 branches with the highest theft rates compared to sales. In bold letters above them is his eye-opening conclusion. The branches with the highest theft rate are primarily in rural areas. After a moment of silence and disbelief, the CEO is first to speak.
-  The branches with the highest theft rate are primarily in rural areas. After a moment of silence and disbelief, the CEO is first to speak. Ladies and gentlemen, the next steps are clear. From now on, we'll install additional safety systems in all rural branches. Let's see those hillbillies steal from us then, eh? Do we all agree? Mmm, not completely. You ask the consultant to call up the hundred branches with the lowest theft rates. After some swift sorting, the list appears. Surprise, surprise. The shops with the least amount of shoplifting in relation to sales are also in rural areas. The location isn't the deciding factor, you begin, smiling somewhat smugly as you gaze around the table at your colleagues. What counts is the size of the store. In the countryside, the branches tend to be small, meaning a single branch is not enough.
-  The location isn't the deciding factor, you begin, smiling somewhat smugly as you gaze around the table at your colleagues. What counts is the size of the store. In the countryside, the branches tend to be small, meaning a single incident has a much larger influence on the theft rate. Therefore, the rural branches' rates vary greatly, much more than the larger city branches. Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you the law of small numbers. It has just caught you out. The law of small numbers is not something we understand intuitively. Thus, people, especially journalists, managers and board members, continually fall for it. Let's examine an extreme example. Instead of the theft rate, consider the average weight of employees in a branch. Instead of a thousand stores, we'll take just two.
-  and new businesses the highest and lowest scores. The National Institute study has zero significance. It simply confirms the laws of chance. So watch out when you hear remarkable statistics about any small entities, businesses, households, cities, data centers, anthills, parishes, schools, and so on. What's being peddled as an astounding finding is in fact a humdrum consequence of random distribution. In his latest book, Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman reveals that even experienced scientists succumb to the law of small numbers. How reassuring.
-  the scent and so must draw on all the accounting artifices available. Fortunately, expectations can also lead to commendable incentives. In 1965, the American psychologist Robert Rosenthal conducted a noteworthy experiment in various schools. Teachers were told of a fake new test that could identify students who were on the verge of an intellectual spurt, so-called bloomers. 20% of students were randomly selected and classified as such. Teachers remained under the impression that these were indeed high potential students. After a year, Rosenthal discovered that these students had developed much higher IQs than other children in the world.
-  that these were indeed high potential students. After a year, Rosenthal discovered that these students had developed much higher IQs than other children in a control group. This effect became known as the Rosenthal effect, or Pygmalion effect. Unlike the CEOs and CFOs who consciously tailor their performance to meet expectations, the teachers' actions were subconscious. Unknowingly, they probably devoted more time to the bloomers, and consequently the group learned more. The prospect of brilliant students influenced the teachers so much that they ascribed not just better grades, but also improved personality.
-  and consequently the group learned more. The prospect of brilliant students influenced the teachers so much that they ascribed not just better grades, but also improved personality traits to the gifted students. But how do we react to personal expectations? This brings us to the placebo effect, pills and therapies that are unlikely to improve health, but do so anyway. The placebo effect has been registered in one third of all patients. But how it works is not well understood. All we know is that expectations alter the biochemistry of the brain, and thus the whole body.
-  Expectations are intangible, but their effect is quite real. They have the power to change reality. Can we deprogram them? Is it possible to live a life free from expectations? Unfortunately not. But you can deal with them more cautiously. Raise expectations for yourself and for the people you love. This increases motivation. At the same time, lower expectations for things you cannot control. For example, the stock market. As paradoxical as it sounds, the best way to shield yourself from nasty surprises is to anticipate them.
-  it'll all have been for nothing. Another victim of the sunk cost fallacy. A friend struggled for years in a troubled relationship. His girlfriend cheated on him time and again. Each time she came back repentant and begged for forgiveness. He explained it to me this way. I've invested so much energy in the relationship, it would be wrong to throw it away. A classic case of the sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy is most dangerous when we've invested a lot of time, money, energy or love in something. This investment becomes a reason to carry on, even if we're dealing with a lost cause.
-  Three easy questions. Grab a pen quickly and jot down your answers in the margin. First question. In a department store a ping pong paddle and a plastic ball cost a dollar ten. If the paddle costs one dollar more, how much is the ball? Second question. In a textile factory five machines take exactly five minutes to make five shirts. How many minutes will it take 100 machines to produce 100 shirts? And the third question. A pond has water lilies growing in it. The flowers multiply quickly, each day doubling the area they take up. If it takes
-  Would you rather have $3,400 now or $3,800 in a month? In general, people with the low CRT scores favor getting the smaller amount sooner. For them, waiting poses a challenge because they're more impulsive. This also applies to purchasing decisions. In contrast, people with high CRT results usually decide to wait the extra few weeks. They muster the willpower to turn down instant gratification and are rewarded for it later on. Thinking is more exhausting than sensing. Rational consideration requires more willpower than simply giving in to intuition. In other words, intuitive people tend to scrutinize less. This led Harvard psychologist Amitai Shenhov and his research colleagues to investigate whether people's CRT results correlate with their faith.
-  I've invested so much energy in the relationship, it would be wrong to throw it away. A classic case of the sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy is most dangerous when we've invested a lot of time, money, energy or love in something. This investment becomes a reason to carry on even if we're dealing with a lost cause. The more we invest, the greater the sunk costs are and the greater the urge to continue becomes. Profits frequently fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. Often they base their trading decisions on acquisition prices. I lost so much money with this stock I can't sell it now. They say.
-  This led Harvard psychologist Amitai Shenhov and his research colleagues to investigate whether people's CRT results correlate with their faith. Americans with a high CRT score, the study was conducted only in the United States, are often atheists, and their convictions have been reinforced over the years. Participants with low CRT results, however, tend to believe in God and the immortality of the soul, and often have had divine experiences. This makes sense. The more intuitively people make decisions, the less rationally they query religious beliefs. If you're less than pleased, then you're more than welcome to participate.
-  intuitively people make decisions, the less rationally they query religious beliefs. If you're less than pleased with your CRT score and want to improve it, start by greeting even the simplest logical questions with incredulity. Not everything that seems plausible is true. Reject the easy answers that pop into your head. So one more try. You're traveling from A to B. On the way there, you drive at 100 miles per hour, and on the way back at 50 miles per hour. What was your average speed? 75 miles per hour? Slow down. Slow down.
-  satisfactory proof. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you're extroverted, affable, and sociable, while at other times you're introverted, wary, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. Security is one of your major goals in life. Do you recognize yourself? On a scale from one, poor, to five, excellent. How was my assessment? In 1948, psychologist Bertram Forer crafted this exact passage using astrology columns from various magazines. He then gave it to his students to read, suggesting that each person was getting a personalized assessment. On average, the students rated their characterizations 4.3 out of 5. That is, they gave Forer an accuracy score of 8.5.
-  biologist Bertram Forer crafted this exact passage using astrology columns from various magazines. He then gave it to his students to read, suggesting that each person was getting a personalized assessment. On average, the students rated their characterizations 4.3 out of 5. That is, they gave Forer an accuracy score of 86%. The experiment was repeated hundreds of times the decades that followed with virtually identical results. Most likely, you gave the text of 4 or 5, too. People tend to identify many of their own traits in such universal descriptions. Science labels this tendency the Forer effect or the Barnum effect. The Forer effect explains why the pseudosciences work so well. Astrology, astrotherapy, the study of handwriting, biorhythm analysis.
-  majority of people identify their description is their real talent at hand. I'm still waiting. 65. Volunteer work is for the birds. Volunteers Folly. Jack, a photographer, is on the go from Monday to Friday. Commissioned by fashion magazines, he divides his time between Milan, Paris, and New York and is constantly in search of the most beautiful girls, the most original designs, and the perfect light. He's well known on the social circuit and the money is great. $500 an hour. Easy. That's as much as a commercial lawyer, he brags to his buddies. And what I have in front of my lens looks a lot better than any banker. Jack leads an enviable life. But lately,
-  Do you have any time? We're meeting at 8 o'clock in the morning. We should be done shortly afternoon. What would Jack say if he really is serious about creating a better world? That's right. He should turn down the request. Why? Jack earns $500 an hour. A carpenter, $50. It would be much more sensible to work an extra hour as a photographer and then hire a professional carpenter for six hours to make good quality birdhouses, which Jack could never hope to accomplish. Taxes aside, he could donate the difference, $200, to the Bird Club. Doing so, his contribution would go much further than if he grabbed a saw and rolled up his sleeves. Nevertheless, it's highly likely that Jack will turn up bright and early next Saturday to build birdhouses. Economists call this volunteer's folly. It's a popular phenomenon.
-  What counts is the stock's future performance, and the future performance of alternative investments. Ironically, the more money a share loses, the more investors tend to stick by it. This irrational behavior is driven by a need for consistency. After all, consistency signifies credibility. We find contradictions abominable. If we decide to cancel a project halfway through, we create a contradiction. We admit that we once thought differently. Continuing on with a meaningless project delays this painful realization and keeps up appearances. The Concord is a prime example of a government deficit.
-  and rolled up his sleeves. Nevertheless, it's highly likely that Jack will turn up bright and early next Saturday to build birdhouses. Economists call this volunteers folly. It's a popular phenomenon. More than one-fourth of Americans volunteer their time. But what makes it folly? Among other things, if Jack chooses to cobble together a few birdhouses himself, it takes away work from a tradesman. Working a little longer and donating a portion of the earnings is the most effective contribution Jack can make. Hands-on volunteer work would be helpful only if he could make use of his expertise. If the bird club

Working a little longer and donating a portion of the earnings is the most effective contribution Jack can make. Hands-on volunteer work would be helpful only if he could make use of his expertise. If the bird club were planning a fundraising mail campaign and needed a professional photo, Jack could either shoot it himself or work an hour longer to hire another top photographer and donate the remainder. So now we come to the thorny topic of altruism. Does selflessness exist at all, or is it merely a bomb to our egos? Although a desire to help the community motivates many volunteers, personal benefits play a big part, such as gaining skills, experience, and contacts. Suddenly, we're not acting quite so selflessly.
-  Does selflessness exist at all, or is it merely a bomb to our egos? Although a desire to help the community motivates many volunteers, personal benefits play a big part, such as gaining skills, experience, and context. Suddenly, we're not acting quite so selflessly. Indeed, many volunteers engage in what might be deemed personal happiness management, the benefits of which are sometimes far removed from the real cause. Simply speaking, anyone who profits or feels even the slightest satisfaction from volunteering is not a pure altruist. So does it mean Jack is a fool if he turns up, hammering

It's a complex issue. You don't want to answer too hastily. A rational approach would be to consider the controversial technologies pros and cons separately. Write down the possible benefits, weigh them in terms of importance, and then multiply them by the probability that they will occur. Doing so, you get a list of expected values. Next, do the same with the cons. List all the disadvantages, estimate their potential damage, and multiply them by the likelihood of them happening. The positive sum minus positive sum.
-  do the same with the cons. List all the disadvantages, estimate their potential damage, and multiply them by the likelihood of them happening. The positive sum minus the negative sum equals the net expected value. If it's above zero, you are in favor of genetically modified wheat. If the sum is below zero, you're against it. More than likely, you've already heard of this approach. It's called expected value, and it features in most literature on decision theory. But just as probable is that you've never bothered to carry out such an evaluation. And without a doubt, none of the professors who wrote the textbooks turned to this method to select their spouses. Truth be told, no one uses this method to make decisions. First of all, we lack enough imagination to list all the possible pros and cons. We're limited by what springs to mind. We can only

We can only conjure up what we have seen in our modest experience. It's hard to imagine a storm of the century if you're only 30 years old. Second, calculating small probabilities is impossible because we don't have enough data on rare events. The smaller the probability, the fewer data points we have and the higher the error rate on the exact probability of vicious effect. Third, our brain is not built for such calculations. They require time and effort, not our preferred state. In our evolutionary past, whoever thought too long and hard vanished inside of predators' jaws. We are the descendants of quick decision-makers and we rely on mental shortcuts called heuristics.

In our evolutionary past, whoever thought too long and hard vanished inside a predator's jaws. We are the descendants of quick decision-makers and we rely on mental shortcuts called heuristics. One of the most popular is the affect heuristic. An affect is a momentary judgment, something you like or dislike. The word gunfire triggers a negative effect. The word luxury produces a positive one. This automatic one-dimensional impulse prevents you from considering risks and benefits to be independent variables, which indeed they are. Instead, the affect heuristic puts risks and benefits on the same sensory thread.
-  produces a positive one. This automatic one-dimensional impulse prevents you from considering risks and benefits to be independent variables, which indeed they are. Instead the affectoristic puts risks and benefits on the same sensory thread. Your emotional reactions to issues such as nuclear power, organic vegetables, private schools, or motorbikes determine how you assess their risks and benefits. If you like something you believe that the risks are smaller and the benefits greater than they actually are. If you don't like something the opposite is true. Risks and benefits appear to be dependent. Of course in reality they're not. Even more impressive, suppose you want a Harley-Davidson. If you come across a study that states that driving one is riskier than previously thought you will subconsciously tweak how you rate the benefits, deeming the
-  100th of a second in front of participants, a smiling face, an angry face, or a neutral figure. The subjects then had to indicate whether they liked a randomly selected Chinese character or not. The participants didn't speak Chinese. Most preferred symbols that immediately followed the smiling face. Seemingly insignificant factors influence our emotions. Here's another example where an insignificant factor plays a role. Researchers David Hirschleifer and Tyler Shumway tested the relationship between the amount of morning sun and daily market performance in 26 major stock exchanges between 1982 and 1997. They found a correlation that reads much like a farmer's adage. If the sun is shining in the morning, the stock market will rise during the day. Not always, but often. Who would have thought that sunshine
-  They found a correlation that reads much like a farmer's adage. If the sun is shining in the morning, the stock market will rise during the day. Not always, but often. Who would have thought that sunshine can move billions? The morning sun obviously has the same effect as a smiley face. Whether we like it or not, we're puppets of our emotions. We make complex decisions by consulting our feelings, not our thoughts. Against our best intentions, we substitute the question, what do I think about this with? How do I feel about this? So smile. Your future depends on it.

His father founded the company when supplements were not yet a lifestyle product, a doctor had to prescribe them. When Bruce took over the operation in the early 90s, demand skyrocketed. Bruce seized the opportunity with both hands and took out huge loans to expand production. Today he's one of the most successful people in the business and president of a national association of vitamin manufacturers. Since childhood, hardly a day has passed without him swallowing at least three multivitamins. A journalist once asked him if they do anything. He replied.
-  would never work. They continued to invest enormous sums of money in it, if only to save face. Abandoning the project would have been tantamount to admitting defeat. The sunk cost fallacy is therefore often referred to as the Concord effect. It leads to costly, even disastrous errors of judgment. The Americans extended their involvement in the Vietnam War because of this. You're thinking, we've already sacrificed so much for this war, it'd be a mistake to give up now. We've come this far. I've read so much of this book already. But I've spent two years doing this course. If you recognize any of the books, you're probably thinking, I've read so much of this book already.

-  It's obviously in his interest to believe that vitamins are beneficial. After all, his wealth and social status depend on the success of the company. He has to maintain a family tradition. All his life he's gulped down pills. So he'll never admit that it was a waste of time. For you, however, it's a different story. You have searched deep inside. You are completely impartial. But how pure and honest is internal reflection? The Swedish psychologist Peter Johansson allowed test subjects to glimpse two portrait photos of random people and choose which face was more attractive. Then he showed them the preferred photo up close and asked them to describe the most attractive features. However, with a sleight of hand, he switched the pictures. Most participants failed to notice and proceeded to justify in detail why they favored the image. The result...

Most participants failed to notice and proceeded to justify in detail why they favored the image. The results of the study? Introspection is not reliable. When we soul search, we contrive the findings. The belief that reflection leads to truth or accuracy is called the introspection illusion. This is more than sophistry. Because we're so confident of our beliefs, we experience three reactions when someone fails to share our views. Response one, assumption of ignorance. The other party clearly lacks the necessary information. If he knew what you know, he would be of the same opinion. Political activists think this way. They believe they can win others over through enlightenment. Reaction two,
-  clearly lacks the necessary information. If he knew what you know, he would be of the same opinion. Political activists think this way. They believe they can win others over through enlightenment. Reaction 2. Assumption of Idiocy. The other person has the necessary information, but his mind is underdeveloped. He cannot draw the obvious conclusions. In other words, he's a moron. This reaction is particularly popular with bureaucrats who want to protect stupid consumers from themselves. Response 3. Assumption of Malice. Your counterpart has the necessary information. He even understands the debate, but he is deliberately confrontational. He has evil intentions. This is how many religious leaders and followers treat disbelievers. If they don't agree, they must be servants of the devil.
-  Unfortunately, introspection is, in large part, fabrication posing two dangers. First, the introspection illusion creates inaccurate predictions of future mental states. Trust your internal observations too much and too long, and you might be in for a very rude awakening. Second, we believe that our introspections are more reliable than those of others, which creates an illusion of superiority. Remedy? Be all the more critical with yourself. Regard your internal observations with the same skepticism as claims from some random person. Become your own toughest critic.

I have dipped in and out of all of them, but am unable to part with even one. I know that sporadic reading won't help me achieve any real insights, despite the many hours I put in, and that I really should devote myself to one book at a time. So why am I still juggling all 24? I know a man who is dating three women. He's in love with all three and can imagine starting a family with any of them. However, he simply doesn't have the heart to choose just one, because then he would be passing up on the other two for good. If he refrains from deciding, all of them are good.
-  Spanish conquistador Cortes used the same motivational trick in the 16th century. After landing on the east coast of Mexico, he sank his own ship. Jean-Yu and Cortes are exceptions. We mere mortals do everything we can to keep open the maximum number of options. Psychology professors Dan Errally and Ji Weng-Shin demonstrated the strength of this instinct using a computer game. Players started with 100 points and on the screen in front of them, three doors appeared. A red one, a blue one, and a green one. Opening a door cost a point, but for every room they entered, they could accrue more points. The players reacted logically. They found the most fruitful room and holed up there for the whole session. Errally and Shin then changed the rules. If doors were not opened within 12 moves, they started shrinking on the screen.
-  is not always apparent. In the financial markets, things are clear. A financial option on a security always costs something. There is no such thing as a free option. In most other realms, however, options seem to be free. But this is an illusion. They also come at a price, but the price tag is often hidden and intangible. Each decision costs mental energy and eats up precious time for thinking and living. CEOs who examine every possible expansion option often choose none in the end. Companies that aim to address all customer segments end up addressing no one. Salespeople who chase every single lead close no deals. We're obsessed with having as many irons as possible in the fire, ruling nothing out and being open to everything. However, this can easily destroy success. We must
-  Close no deals. We're obsessed with having as many irons as possible in the fire, ruling nothing out and being open to everything. However, this can easily destroy success. We must learn to close doors. A business strategy is primarily a statement on what not to engage in. Adopt a life strategy similar to a corporate strategy. Write down what not to pursue in your life. In other words, make calculated decisions to disregard certain possibilities, and when an option shows up, test it against your not to pursue list. It will not only keep you from trouble, but also save you lots of thinking time. Think hard once and then just consult your list, instead of having to make up your mind whenever a new door cracks open. Most doors are not worth entering, even when the handle seems to turn so effortlessly.

What will your everyday life be like? With which items will you surround yourself? People who pondered this question 50 years ago had fanciful notions of how the future would look. Highways in the skies. Cities that resemble glass worlds. Bullet trains winding between gleaming skyscrapers. We would live in plastic capsules, work in underground cities, vacation on the moon, and consume everything in pill form. We wouldn't conceive offspring anymore. Instead we would choose children from a catalogue. Our best friends would be robots.
-  The idea behind your leather shoes comes from the last Ice Age. Your bookshelves are made of wood, one of the oldest building materials in the world. At dinnertime you use a fork, a well-known killer app from Roman times, to shovel chunks of dead animals and plants into your mouths. Nothing has changed. How will the world look in 50 years? In his latest book, Anti-Fragile, Nassim Taleb gives us a clue. Assume that most of the technology that has existed for the past 50 years will serve us for another half century. And assume that recent technology will be passÃ© in a few years' time. Why? Think of these inventions as if they were species. Whatever has held its own throughout centuries of innovation will probably continue to do so in the future too. Old technology has proven itself. It potentially has.

It possesses an inherent logic, even if we don't always understand it. If something has endured for epochs, it must be worth its salt. You can take this to heart the next time you're in a strategy meeting. Fifty years into the future will look a lot like today. Of course, you'll witness the birth of many flashy gadgets and magic contraptions, but most will be short-lived. When contemplating the future, we place far too much emphasis on flavor of the month inventions and the latest killer apps while underestimating the role of traditional technology. In the 1960s, space travel was all the rage, so we imagined ourselves on school trips to Mars. In the 70s, plastic was in,

In the 70s, plastic was in, so we mulled over how we would furnish our see-through houses. Taleb traces this tendency back to the neomania pitfall, the mania for all things shiny and new. In the past, I sympathized with the so-called early adopters, the breed of people who cannot survive without the latest iPhone. I thought they were ahead of their time. Now I regard them as irrational and suffering from a kind of sickness, neomania. To them, it's of minor importance if an invention provides tangible benefits. Novelty matters more.

Made in 1968, the movie predicted that at the turn of the millennium, the United States would have a thousand-strong colony on the moon and that Pan Am would operate the commuter flights there and back. With this fanciful forecast in mind, I suggest a rule of thumb. Whoever has survived for X years will last another X years. Tell up wagers that the bullshit filter of history will sort the gimmicks from the game changers. And that's one bet I'm willing to back.

During World War II, every nation produced propaganda movies. These were devised to fill the population, especially soldiers, with enthusiasm for the country and, if necessary, to bolster them to lay down their lives. The United States spent so much money on propaganda that the War Department decided to find out whether the expense was really worth it. A number of studies were carried out to investigate how the movies affected regular soldiers. The result was disappointing. They did not intensify the privates' enthusiasm for war in the slightest. Was it because they were poorly made?
-  It didn't matter. Its content was deemed hollow from the outset and dismissed. Nine weeks later, something unexpected happened. The psychologists measured the soldiers' attitudes a second time. The result? Whoever had seen the movie expressed much more support for the war than those who had not viewed it. Apparently propaganda did work after all. The scientists were baffled, especially since they knew that an argument's persuasiveness decreased over time. It has a half-life like a radioactive substance. Surely you've experienced this yourself. Let's say you read an article on the benefits of gene therapy. Immediately after reading it, you're a zealous convert. But after a few weeks, you don't really remember why. More time passes until only a tiny fraction of enthusiasm remains. Amazingly, just the opposite is true for propaganda. If it strikes a chord with you, you're a genius.
-  More time passes until only a tiny fraction of enthusiasm remains. Amazingly, just the opposite is true for propaganda. If it strikes a chord with someone, this influence will only increase over time. Why? Psychologist Karl Hovland, who led the study for the War Department, named this phenomenon the sleeper effect. To date, the best explanation is that in our memories, the source of the argument fades faster than the argument. In other words, your brain quickly forgets where the information came from, such as from the Department of Propaganda. Meanwhile, the message itself, that is, war is necessary and noble, fades only slowly or even endures. Therefore, any knowledge that stems from an untrustworthy source gains credibility over time. The discrediting force melts away faster
-  In the United States, elections increasingly revolve around nasty advertisements, in which candidates seek to tarnish one another's record or reputation. However, by law, each political ad must disclose its sponsor at the end, so that it is clearly distinguishable as an electioneering message. However, countless studies show that the sleeper effect does its job here, too, especially among undecided voters. The messenger fades from memory, the ugly accusations persevere. I've often wondered why advertising works at all. Any logical person must recognize ads for what they are, and suitably categorize and disqualify them. But even you, as a discerning and intelligent listener, won't always succeed at this. It's quite possible that after a few weeks, you won't remember if you picked up certain information from a well-researched article or from a tacky ad.
-  as a discerning and intelligent listener won't always succeed at this. It's quite possible that after a few weeks, you won't remember if you picked up certain information from a well-researched article or from a tacky advertorial. How can you thwart the sleeper effect? First, don't accept any unsolicited advice, even if it seems well-met. Doing so, you protect yourself, to a certain degree, from manipulation. Second, avoid ad-contaminated sources like the plague. How fortunate we are that books are still ad-free. Third, try to remember the source of every argument you encounter. Whose opinions are these, and why do they think that way? Probe the issue like an investigator would. Qui bono? Who benefits? Admittedly, this is a lot of work and will slow down your decision-making, but it will also refine it.
-  Admittedly, this is a lot of work and will slow down your decision making, but it will also refine it. 71. Why it's never just a two-horse race. Alternative blindness. You leaf through a brochure that gushes about the benefits of the university's MBA degree. Your gaze sweeps over photos of the ivy-colored campus and the ultra-modern sports facilities. Sprinkled throughout are images of smiling students from various ethnic backgrounds, with an emphasis on young women, young Chinese, and young Indian go-getters. On the last page, you come to an overview that illustrates the financial value of an MBA. The $100,000 fee is easily offset by the statistical extra income that graduates earn before they retire.
-  of an MBA. The $100,000 fee is easily offset by the statistical extra income that graduates earn before they retire. $400,000 after taxes. Who wouldn't want to be up $300,000? It's a no-brainer. Wrong. Such an argument hides not one, but four fallacies. First, we have the swimmer's body illusion. MBA programs attract career-oriented people who will probably earn above-average salaries at some stage of their careers, even without the extra qualification of an MBA. The second fallacy, an MBA takes two years. During this time, you can expect a loss of earnings, say $100,000. So in fact, the MBA costs $200,000, not $100,000. That amount, if invested well, could easily exceed the additional income
-  During this time you can expect a loss of earnings say $100,000 so in fact the MBA costs $200,000 not $100,000 That amount if invested well could easily exceed the additional income that the brochure promises Third to estimate earnings that are more than 30 years away is idiotic who knows what will happen over the next three decades Finally other alternatives exist you are not stuck between do an MBA and don't do an MBA Perhaps you can find a different program that costs significantly less and also represents a shot in the arm for your career This fourth misconception interests me the most Let's call it alternative blindness We systematically forget to compare an existing offer with the next best alternative Here's an example from the world of finance
-  Don't do an MBA. Perhaps you can find a different program that costs significantly less and also represents a shot in the arm for your career. This fourth misconception interests me the most. Let's call it alternative blindness. We systematically forget to compare an existing offer with the next best alternative. Here's an example from the world of finance. Suppose you have a little money in your savings account and you ask your investment broker for advice. He proposes a bond that will earn you 5% interest. That's much better than the 1% you get with your savings account, he points out. Does it make sense to buy the bond? We don't know. It's wrong to consider just these two options. To assess your options properly, you would have to compare the bond with all other investment options and then select the best. This is how top investor Warren Buffett does things.
-  we measure against the second best deal that is available at any given time, even if it means doing more of what we're already doing. Unlike Warren Buffett, politicians often fall victim to alternative blindness. Let's say your city is planning to build a sports arena on a vacant plot of land. Supporters argue that such an arena would benefit the population much more than an empty lot, both emotionally and financially. But this comparison is wrong. They should compare the construction of the sports arena with all other ideas that become impossible due to its construction. For example, building a school, a performing arts center, a hospital, or an incinerator. They could also sell the land and invest the proceeds or reduce the city's debt. And you? Do you often overlook the alternatives? Let's say your doctor decides
-  or an incinerator. They could also sell the land and invest the proceeds or reduce the city's debt. And you? Do you often overlook the alternatives? Let's say your doctor discovers a tumor that will kill you in five years. He proposes a complicated operation that, if successful, removes the tumor completely. However, this procedure is highly risky with a survival rate of just 50%. How do you decide? You weigh up your choices. Certain death in five years, or a 50% chance of dying next week. Alternative blindness. Perhaps there is a variant of the invasive surgery that your hospital doesn't offer, but a hospital across town does. This invasive surgery might not remove the tumor altogether, just slow its growth, but is much safer and gives you an extra ten years. And who knows? Maybe you're
-  However, this procedure is highly risky with a survival rate of just 50%. How do you decide? You weigh up your choices. Certain death in five years or a 50% chance of dying next week. Alternative blindness. Perhaps there is a variant of the invasive surgery that your hospital doesn't offer, but a hospital across town does. This invasive surgery might not remove the tumor altogether, just slow its growth, but is much safer and gives you an extra 10 years. And who knows? Maybe during these 10 years a more sophisticated therapy for eradicating tumors will be made available. The bottom line? If you have trouble making a decision, remember that the choices are broader than no surgery or highly risky surgery. Forget about the rock and the hard place and open your eyes to the other, superior alternatives.
-  Psychologist Robert Cialdini can explain the success of this and other such campaigns. He has studied the phenomenon of reciprocity and has established that people have extreme difficulty being in another person's debt. Many NGOs and philanthropic organizations use exactly the same techniques. First give, then take. Last week, a conservation organization sent me an envelope full of postcards featuring all sorts of idyllic landscapes. The accompanying letter assured me that the postcards were a gift to be kept, whether or not I decided to donate to their organization. Even though I understood the tactic, it took a lot of time.
-  As one of my books reached number one on the bestseller list, my publisher asked me for a favor. An acquaintance's title was on the verge of entering the top 10 list, and the publisher was convinced that a testimonial from me would give it the necessary push. It always amazes me that these little testimonials work at all. Everyone knows that only favorable comments end up on a book's jacket. The book you hold in your hands is no exception. A rational reader should ignore the praise or at least consider it alongside the criticism, which is always available, albeit in different places. Nevertheless, I've written plenty of testimonials for a good cause.
-  are gifted at overlooking the extent of their incompetence. They suffer from illusory superiority, which leads them to make even more thinking errors, thus creating a vicious cycle that erodes the talent pool over time. While his school was closed due to an outbreak of plague in 1666 to 1667, 25-year-old Isaac Newton showed his professor, Isaac Barrow, what research he was conducting in his spare time. Barrow immediately gave up his job as a professor and became a student of Newton. What a noble gesture. What ethical behavior. When was the last time you heard of a professor vacating his post in favor of Newton?
-  In the early 1960s, when the president of the United States was elected to the presidency in 1867, 25-year-old Isaac Newton showed his professor, Isaac Barrow, what research he was conducting in his spare time. Barrow immediately gave up his job as a professor and became a student of Newton. What a noble gesture. What ethical behavior. When was the last time you heard of a professor vacating his post in favor of a better job? In conclusion, do you foster individuals more talented than you? Admittedly, in the short term, the preponderance of stars can endanger your status. But in the long run, you can only profit from their contributions. Others will overtake you at some stage anyway. Until then, you should get in the up-and-comers' good books and learn from them. This is why
-  the up-and-comers good books and learn from them. This is why I wrote the testimonial in the end. 73. Why first impressions are deceiving, primacy and recency effects. Allow me to introduce you to two men, Alan and Ben. Without thinking about it too long, decide whom you prefer. Alan is smart, hard-working, impulsive, critical, stubborn and jealous. Ben, however, is jealous, stubborn, critical, impulsive, hard-working and smart. Who would you prefer to get stuck with in an elevator? Most people choose Alan even though the descriptions are exactly the same. Your brain pays more attention to the first adjectives in the lists, causing you to identify two different personalities. Alan is smart and hard-working.
-  This is called the primacy effect. If it were not for the primacy effect, people would refrain from decking out their headquarters with luxuriously appointed entrance halls. Your lawyer would feel happy turning up to meet you in worn out sneakers rather than beautifully polished designer oxen. The primacy effect is a very common trait in the United States. It's a very common trait. It's a very common trait. It's a very common trait. It's a very common trait. It's a very common trait. The primacy effect triggers practical errors too. Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman describes how he used to grade examination papers at the beginning of his professorship. He did it, as most teachers do, in order. Student one followed by student two and so on. This meant that students who answered the first questions flawlessly endeared themselves to him, thus affecting the students' lives.
-  He did it as most teachers do, in order. Student one followed by student two and so on. This meant that students who answered the first questions flawlessly endeared themselves to him, thus affecting how he graded the remaining parts of their exams. So Kahneman switched methods and began to grade the individual questions in batches. All the answers to question one, then the answers to question two and so forth. Thus he canceled out the primacy effect. Unfortunately, this trick is not always replicable. When recruiting a new employee, for example, you run the risk of hiring the person who makes the best first impression. Ideally, you would set up all the candidates in order and let them answer the same question one after the other. Suppose you sit on the board of a company. A point of discussion is raised, a topic on which you have not yet passed judgment. The first opinion you hear
-  Unfortunately, this trick is not always replicable. When recruiting a new employee, for example, you run the risk of hiring the person who makes the best first impression. Ideally, you would set up all the candidates in order and let them answer the same question one after the other. Suppose you sit on the board of a company. A point of discussion is raised, a topic on which you have not yet passed judgment. The first opinion you hear will be crucial to your overall assessment. The same applies to the other participants, a fact that you can exploit. If you have an opinion, don't hesitate airing it first. This way you will influence your colleagues more and draw them over to your side. If however you're chairing the committee, always ask members' opinions in random order so that no one has an unfair advantage. The primacy effect is not always the culprit. The contrasting recency effect matters.
-  here will be crucial to your overall assessment. The same applies to the other participants, a fact that you can exploit. If you have an opinion, don't hesitate airing it first. This way you will influence your colleagues more and draw them over to your side. If, however, you're chairing the committee, always ask members' opinions in random order so that no one has an unfair advantage. The primacy effect is not always the culprit. The contrasting recency effect matters as well. The more recent the information, the better we remember it. This occurs because our short-term memory file drawer, as it were, contains very little extra space. When a new piece of information gets filed, an older piece of information is discarded to make room. When does the primacy effect supersede the recency effect, or vice versa? If you have to make
-  This occurs because our short-term memory file drawer, as it were, contains very little extra space. When a new piece of information gets filed, an older piece of information is discarded to make room. When does the primacy effect supersede the recency effect, or vice versa? If you have to make an immediate decision based on a series of impressions, such as characteristics, exam answers, etc., the primacy effect weighs heavier. But if the series of impressions was formed some time ago, the recency effect dominates. For instance, if you listened to a speech a few weeks ago, you'll remember the final point or punchline more clearly than your first impressions. In conclusion, first and last impressions dominate, meaning the content sandwiched between has only a weak influence. Try to avoid evaluations based on first impressions.
-  few weeks ago, you'll remember the final point or punchline more clearly than your first impressions. In conclusion, first and last impressions dominate, meaning the content sandwiched between has only a weak influence. Try to avoid evaluations based on first impressions. They will deceive you guaranteed in one way or another. Try to assess all aspects impartially. It's not easy, but there are ways around it. For example, in interviews I jot down a score every five minutes and calculate the average afterward. This way I make sure that the middle counts just as much as hello and goodbye.
-  even though his firm is the market leader in terms of service, security, and functionality. Most insurers are convinced that the best solution is what they have crafted themselves in-house over the past 30 years. Another CEO told me how hard it is to get his staff in the company's headquarters to accept solutions proposed from far-flung subsidiaries. When people collaborate to solve problems and then evaluate these ideas themselves, NIH syndrome will inevitably exert an influence. Thus, it makes sense to split teams into two groups. The first group generates ideas, the second rates them, and vice versa. We tend to rate our own business ideas as more successful than other people's concepts. This self-confidence forms the basis of thriving entrepreneurship, but also explains startups' frequently miserable returns.
-  their own responses as more important and applicable than the others, even though the submissions were virtually identical. On a societal level, NIH syndrome has serious consequences. We overlook shrewd ideas simply because they come from other cultures. In Switzerland, where each state or canton has certain powers, one tiny canton never approved women's suffrage. It took a federal court ruling in 1990 to change the law, a startling case of NIH. Or consider the modern traffic roundabout, with its clear yield requirements that was designed by British transport engineers in the 1960s and implemented throughout the UK. It took another 30 years full of oblivion and resistance until this obvious traffic decongestant found its way in the United States and continental Europe. Today, France alone has more than

-  year out the Dow Jones rises and falls a little. Gradually you grow accustomed to this gentle up and down. Then suddenly a day like October 19th, 1987 comes around and the stock market tumbles 22% with no warning. This event is a black swan as described by Nassim Taleb in his book with the same title. A black swan is an unthinkable event that massively affects your life, your career, your company, your country. There are positive and negative black swans. The meteorite that flattens you, Sutter's discovery of gold in California, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the invention of the transistor, the internet browser, the overthrow of Egyptian dictator Mubarak, or another encounter that upturns your life completely. All are black swans. Think what you like of former US Secretary of State.
-  the internet browser, the overthrow of Egyptian dictator Mubarak, or another encounter that upturns your life completely. All are black swans. Think what you like of former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, but at a press conference in 2002 he expressed a philosophical thought with exceptional clarity when he offered this observation. There are things we know, known facts. There are things we do not know, known unknowns. And there are things we do not know that we do not know, unknown unknowns. How big is the universe? Does Iran have nuclear weapons? Does the internet make
-  consequential. Though we can continue to plan for the future, black swans often destroy our best laid plans. Feedback loops and nonlinear influences interact and cause unexpected results. The reason? Our brains are designed to help us hunt and gather. Back in the Stone Age we hardly ever encountered anything truly extraordinary. The deer we chased was sometimes a bit faster or slower, sometimes a little bit fatter or thinner. Everything revolved around a stable mean. Today is different. With one breakthrough you can increase your income by a factor of 10,000. Just ask Larry Page, Usain Bolt, George Soros, JK Rowling or Bono. Such fortunes did not exist previously. Peaks of this size were unknown. Only in the most recent of human history has this been possible. Hence our problem.
-  and countless species of animals would be long extinct. It's at the core of cooperation between people who are not related and a necessary ingredient for economic growth and wealth creation. There would be no global economy without it. There would be no economy at all. That's the good side of reciprocity. But there's also an ugly side of reciprocity, retaliation. Revenge breeds counter-revenge, and you soon find yourself in a full-scale war. Jesus preached that we should break this cycle by turning the other cheek, which proves very difficult to do. So compelling is the pull of reciprocity, even when the stakes are high.
-  Put yourself in situations where you can catch a ride on a positive black swan, as unlikely as that is. Become an artist, inventor, or entrepreneur with a scalable product. If you sell your time, for example as an employee, dentist, or journalist, you're waiting in vain for such a break. But even if you feel compelled to continue as such, avoid surroundings where negative black swans thrive. This means stay out of debt, invest your savings as conservatively as possible, and get used to a modest standard of living, no matter whether your big breakthrough comes or not.
-  Get used to a modest standard of living, no matter whether your big breakthrough comes or not. 76. Knowledge is non-transferable. Domain dependence. Writing books about clear thinking brings with it many pluses. Business leaders and investors invite me to give talks for good money. Incidentally, this is in itself poor judgment on their part. Books are much cheaper. At a medical conference, the following happened to me. I was speaking about base rate neglect and illustrated it with a medical example. In a 40-year-old patient, stabbing chest pain, among other things, may indicate heart problems as well as stress. Stress is much more frequent, with a higher base rate, so it's advisable to test the patient for this first. All this is very real.

In a 40 year old patient, stabbing chest pain among other things may indicate heart problems as well as stress. Stress is much more frequent with a higher base rate, so it's advisable to test the patient for this first. All this is very reasonable and the doctors understood it but when I used an example from economics, most faltered. The same thing happens when I speak in front of investors. If I illustrate fallacies using financial examples, most catch on immediately. However, if I take instances from biology, many are lost. The conclusion? Insights do not pass well from one field to another. This effect is called domain dependence. In 1990, Harry Martin, the
-  private realm is particularly difficult to navigate. I know CEOs who are charismatic leaders in the office and hopeless duds at home. Similarly, it would be a hard task to find a more cigarette toting profession than the prophets of health themselves, the doctors. Police officers are twice as violent at home as civilians. Literary critics novels get the poorest reviews. And almost proverbially, the marriages of couples therapists are frequently more fragile than those of their clients. Mathematics professor Barry Mazur tells this story. Some years ago I was trying

Of course, this also counts for this book. It will be difficult to transfer.

The Myth of Like-Mindedness False Consensus Effect Which do you prefer, music from the 60s or music from the 80s? How do you think the general public would answer this question? Most people tend to extrapolate their preferences onto others. If they love the 60s, they will automatically assume that the majority of their peers do, too. The same goes for 80 aficionados. We frequently overestimate unanimity with others, believing that everyone else thinks and feels exactly like we do. This fallacy is called the false consensus effect. Stanford psychologist Lee Ross hit upon this in 1971.
-  This fallacy is called the false consensus effect. Stanford psychologist Lee Ross hit upon this in 1977. He fashioned a sandwich board emblazoned with the slogan, eat at Joe's, and asked randomly selected students to wear it around campus for 30 minutes. They also had to estimate how many other students would put themselves forward for the task. Those who declared themselves willing to wear the sign assume that the majority, 62%, would also agree to it. On the other hand, those who politely refused believed that most people, 67%, would find it too stupid to undertake. In both cases, the students imagined themselves to be in the popular majority. The false consensus effect thrives in interest groups and political factions that consistently overrate the popularity of their causes. An obvious example is global warming.
-  evolution didn't eliminate it. Our brain is not built to recognize the truth. Instead, its goal is to leave behind as many offspring as possible. Whoever seemed courageous and convincing, thanks to the false consensus effect, created a positive impression, attracted a disproportionate amount of resources, and thus increased their chances of passing on their genes to future generations. Doubters were less sexy. In conclusion, assume that your worldview is not born by the public. More than that, do not assume that those who think differently are idiots. Before you distrust them, question your own assumptions.

-  from fully agree to completely disagree. Ten years later, he interviewed them again on the same topics and also asked what they had replied ten years previously. The result? What they recalled disclosing in 1973 was almost identical to their present-day views and a far cry from their original responses. By subconsciously adjusting past views to fit present ones, we avoid any embarrassing proof of our fallibility. It's a clever coping strategy because no matter how tough we are, admitting mistakes is an emotionally difficult task. But this is preposterous. Shouldn't we let out a whoop of joy every time we realize we're wrong? After all, such admissions would ensure we'll never make the same mistake twice and have essentially taken a step forward. But we don't see it that way. So does this mean
-  are adamant that they would easily recognize the perpetrator again. 79. Why you identify with your football team. In-group, out-group bias. When I was a child, a typical wintery Sunday looked like this. My family sat in front of the TV watching a ski race. My parents cheered for the Swiss skiers and wanted me to do the same. I didn't understand the fuss. First, why zoom down a mountain on two planks? It makes as little sense as hopping up the mountain on one leg, while juggling three balls and stopping every hundred feet to hurl a log as far as possible.
-  Why should I identify with the Swiss skiers? Was I related to any of them? I didn't think so. I didn't even know what they thought or read. And if I lived a few feet over the Swiss border, I would probably have to cheer for another team altogether. This brings us to the question, does identifying with a group, a sports team, an ethnicity, a company, a state, represent flawed thinking? Over thousands of years, evolution has shaped every behavioral pattern, including attraction to certain groups. In times past, group membership was vital. Fending for yourself was close to impossible. As people began to form alliances, all had to follow suit. Individuals stood no chance against collectives. Whoever rejected membership or got expelled forfeited their place not only in the group, but also in the gene pool. No wonder we're such social animals. Our ancestors.
-  refuse their offer unless you want to end up with a refrigerator full of stuff you don't even like. 7. Beware the special case. Confirmation bias part 1. Gil wants to lose weight. He selects a particular diet and checks his progress on the scale every morning. If he has lost weight, he pats himself on the back and considers the diet a success. If he has gained weight, he writes it off as a normal fluctuation and forgets about it. For months, he lives under the illusion that the diet is working even though his weight remains constant.
-  same emotions without blood relationship. Such feelings can lead to the most idiotic cognitive error of all, laying down your life for a random group, also known as going to war. It is no coincidence that motherland suggests kinship, and it's not by chance that the goal of any military training is to forge soldiers together as brothers. In conclusion, prejudice and aversion are biological responses to anything foreign. Identifying with a group has been a survival strategy for hundreds of thousands of years. Not any longer. Identifying with a group distorts your view of the facts. Should you ever be sent to war, and you don't
-  Should you ever be sent to war and you don't agree with its goals? Dessert. 80. The difference between risk and uncertainty. Ambiguity aversion. Two boxes. Box A contains 100 balls, 50 red and 50 black. Box B also holds 100 balls, but you don't know how many are red and how many are black. If you reach into one of the boxes without looking and draw out a red ball, you win $100. Which box will you choose, A or B? The majority will opt for A. Let's play again using exactly the same boxes. This time you win $100 if you draw out a black ball. Which box will you go for now? Most likely you'll choose A again. But that's illogical.
-  This time you win $100 if you draw out a black ball. Which box will you go for now? Most likely you'll choose A again. But that's illogical. In the first round you assume that B contained fewer red balls and more black balls, so rationally you would have to opt for B this time around. Don't worry, you're not alone in this error, quite the opposite. This result is known as the Ellsberg Paradox, named after Daniel Ellsberg, a former Harvard psychologist. As a side note, he later leaked the top secret Pentagon Papers to the press, leading to the downfall of President Nixon. The Ellsberg Paradox offers empirical proof that we favor known probabilities, box A, over unknown ones, box B. Thus we come to the topics of risk and uncertainty, or ambiguity, and the differences between them. Risk means that the probabilities
-  probabilities, box A, over unknown ones, box B. Thus we come to the topics of risk and uncertainty, or ambiguity, and the differences between them. Risk means that the probabilities are known. Uncertainty means that the probabilities are unknown. On the basis of risk, you can decide whether or not to take a gamble. In the realm of uncertainty, though, it's much harder to make decisions. The two main categories, risk and uncertainty, are as frequently mixed up as cappuccino and latte macchiato, with much graver consequences. You can make calculations with risk, but not with uncertainty. The 300-year-old science of risk is called statistics. A host of professors deal with it, but not a single textbook exists on the subject of uncertainty. Because of this, we try to squeeze ambiguity into risk categories, but it doesn't really fit.
-  If he has gained weight, he writes it off as a normal fluctuation and forgets about it. For months, he lives under the illusion that the diet is working, even though his weight remains constant. Gill is a victim of the confirmation bias, albeit a harmless form of it. The confirmation bias is the mother of all misconceptions. It's the tendency to interpret new information so that it becomes compatible with our existing theories, beliefs, and convictions. In other words, we filter out any new information that contradicts our existing views, disconfirming evidence. This is a dangerous practice.
-  into risk categories, but it doesn't really fit. Let's look at two examples, one from medicine, where it works, and one from the economy, where it does not. There are billions of humans on Earth. Our bodies do not differ dramatically. We all reach a similar height. No one will ever be 100 feet tall and a similar age. No one will live for 10,000 years or for only a millisecond. Most of us have two eyes, four heart valves, 32 teeth. Another species would consider us to be homogeneous, as similar to one another as we consider mice to be. For this reason, there are many similar diseases, and it makes sense to say, for example, there is a 30% risk you will die of cancer. On the other hand, the following assertion is meaningless. There is a 30% chance that the euro will collapse in the next five years. Why? The economy is not going to be a good place to live.
-  probabilities. The difference between risk and uncertainty also illustrates the difference between life insurance and credit default swaps. A credit default swap is an insurance policy against specific defaults, a particular company's inability to pay. In the first case, life insurance, we're in the calculable domain of risk. In the second, credit default swap, we're dealing with uncertainty. This confusion contributed to the chaos of the financial crisis in 2008. If you hear phrases such as, the risk of hyperinflation is X percent, or the risk to our equity position is Y, start worrying. To avoid hasty judgment, you must learn to tolerate ambiguity. This is a difficult task and one that you cannot influence actively. Your amygdala plays a crucial role. This is a nut-sized area.
-  Depending on how it's built, you'll tolerate uncertainty with greater ease or difficulty. This is evident not least in your political orientation. The more averse you are to uncertainty, the more conservatively you will vote. Your political views have a partial biological underpinning. Either way, whoever hopes to think clearly must understand the difference between risk and uncertainty. Only in very few areas can we count on clear probabilities. Casinos, coin tosses, and probability textbooks often were left with troublesome ambiguity. Learn to take it in stride.
-  I found redemption. Our French house wine, RÃ©serve du Patron Bourgogne, $52. I ordered it right away. It couldn't be that bad, I reasoned. I've owned an iPhone for several years now. The gadget allows me to customize everything. Data usage, app synchronization, phone encryption, even how loud I want the camera shutter to sound. How many of these have I set up so far? You guessed it, not one. In my defense, I'm not technically challenged. Rather, I'm just another victim of the so-called default effect. The default setting is as warm and welcoming as a soft pillow, into which we happily collapse. Just as I tend to stick with the house wine and factory cell phone settings, most people cling to the standard options. For example, new cars are often advertised in a certain color. In every catalog,
-  need to provide a few options, always including a default choice for indecisive individuals. This is how New Jersey and Pennsylvania presented two car insurance policies to their inhabitants. The first policy was cheaper but waived certain rights to compensation should an accident take place. New Jersey advertised this as the standard option, and most people were happy to take it. In Pennsylvania, however, the second more expensive option was touted as the standard and promptly became the best seller. This outcome is quite remarkable, especially when you consider that both states' drivers cannot differ all that much in what they want covered or in what they want to pay.
-  the standard and promptly became the best seller. This outcome is quite remarkable, especially when you consider that both states' drivers cannot differ all that much in what they want covered or in what they want to pay. Or consider this experiment. There is a shortage of organ donors. Only about 40 percent of people opt for it. Scientists, Eric Johnson and Dan Goldstein, asked people whether, in the event of death, they wanted to actively opt out of organ donation. By making donation, the default option increased take-up from 40 percent to more than 80 percent of participants. A huge difference between an opt-in and an opt-out default.

Making donation the default option increased take-up from 40% to more than 80% of participants, a huge difference between an opt-in and an opt-out default. The default effect is at work even when no standard option is mentioned. In such cases, we make our past the default setting, thereby prolonging and sanctifying the status quo. People crave what they know. Given the choice of trying something new or sticking to the tried and tested option, we tend to be highly conservative, even if a change would be beneficial.
-  annual fee of $60 for mailing out account statements. I could save myself this amount if I downloaded the statements online. However, though the pricey and paper-guzzling service has bothered me for years, I still can't bring myself to get rid of it once and for all. So where does the status quo bias come from? In addition to sheer convenience, loss aversion plays a role. Recall that losses upset us twice as much as similar gains please us. For this reason, tasks such as renegotiating existing contracts prove very difficult. Regardless of whether these are private or professional, each concession you make weighs twice as heavily.
-  Maybe it just needs a little time to develop, he said after trying the RÃ©serve du Patron. 82. Why last chances make us panic. Fear of regret. Two stories. Paul owns shares in company A. During the year, he considered selling them and buying shares in company B. In the end, he didn't. Today he knows that if he had done so, he would have been up $1,200. Second story. George had shares in company B. During the year, he sold them and bought shares in company A. Today, he also knows that if he had stuck with B, he would have netted an extra $1,200. Who feels more regret? Regret is the feeling of having made the wrong decision. You wish someone would give you a second chance. When asked who feels more regret, you can answer, yes.
-  regret. Regret is the feeling of having made the wrong decision. You wish someone would give you a second chance. When asked who would feel worse, 8% of respondents said Paul, whereas 92% chose George. Why? Considered objectively, the situations are identical. Both Paul and George were unlucky, picked the wrong stock, and were out of pocket for the exact same amount. The only difference, Paul already possessed the shares in A, whereas George went out and bought them. Paul was passive, George active. Paul embodies the majority. Most people leave their money lying where it is for years, and George represents the exception. It seems that whoever does not follow the crowd experiences more regret. It's not always the one who acts who feels more regret. Sometimes, choosing not to act can cause regret.
-  The final victim is the conventional paper-only publisher. Who will regret the series of decisions most and who will gain the most sympathy? Right, the stoic e-grumbler. Here's an example from Daniel Kahneman's book, Thinking, Fast and Slow. After every plane crash, we hear the story of one unlucky person who actually wanted to fly a day earlier or later, but for some reason he changed his booking at the last minute. Since he is the exception, we feel more sympathy for him than for the other normal passengers who were booked on the ill-fated flight from the outset. The fear of regret can make us behave erratically.
-  We tend to act conservatively, so as not to deviate from the crowd too much. No one is immune to this, not even supremely self-confident traders. Statistics show that each year on December 31st, D-Day for performance reviews and bonus calculations, they tend to offload their more exotic stocks and conform to the masses. Similarly, fear of regret and the endowment effect prevent you from throwing away things you no longer require. You're afraid of the remorse you will feel in the unlikely event that you needed those worn-out tennis shoes after all.
-  If you never cared about seeing one before today, why would you fly all the way to Tanzania to do so now? It's irrational. Let's say you've long dreamed of owning a house. Land is becoming scarce. Only a handful of plots with sea views are left. Three remain, then two, and now just one. It's your last chance. This thought racing through your head, you give in and buy the last plot at an exorbitant price. The fear of regret tricked you into thinking this was a one-time offer, when in reality, real estate with a lake view will always come on the market.
-  Everywhere the executives look, they see plenty of confirming evidence. While indications to the contrary remain unseen or are quickly dismissed as exceptions or special cases, they have become blind to disconfirming evidence. What can you do? If the word exception crops up, prick up your ears. Often it hides the presence of disconfirming evidence. It pays to listen to Charles Darwin. Since his youth, he set out to fight the confirmation bias systematically. Whenever observations contradicted his theory, he took them very seriously and noted them down immediately. He knew that the brain actively forgets disconfirming evidence after a short time. The more correct he judged his theory to be, the more actively he looked for contradictions. The following experiment shows how much effort it takes to question your own theory.
-  we're assuming that the statistical relationship between marijuana and car accidents is zero. Thus, Kurt's headline is unfounded. He has fallen victim to the salience effect. Salience refers to a prominent feature, a standout attribute, a particularity, something that catches your eye. The salience effect ensures that outstanding features receive much more attention than they deserve. Since marijuana is the salient feature of this accident, Kurt believes that it's responsible for the crash. A few years later, Kurt moves into business journalism, one of the largest companies in the world.
-  That was the equivalent of about $250 back then, an absolute fortune for a high school student. The money spent little time in my pocket. I soon bought myself a top of the range bike with disc brakes and Shimano gears, one of the best models around. The funny thing was my old bike worked fine. Admittedly, I wasn't completely broke back then. I had managed to save up a few hundred francs through mowing grass in the neighborhood. However, it never crossed my mind to spend this hard-earned money on something so unnecessary. The most I treated myself to was a trip to the movies every now and then. It was only upon reflection that I realized how irrational my behavior had been. Money is money, after all. But we don't see it that way. Depending on how we get it, we treat it differently. Money is not naked. It's wrapped in an emotional shroud. Two questions. You've...
-  after all, but we don't see it that way. Depending on how we get it, we treat it differently. Money is not naked. It's wrapped in an emotional shroud. Two questions. You've worked hard for a year. At the end of the 12 months, you have $20,000 more in your account than you had at the beginning. What do you do? A, leave it sitting in the bank? B, invest it? C, use it to make necessary improvements, such as renovating your moldy kitchen or replacing old tires? D, treat yourself to a luxury cruise? If you think like most people, you'll opt for A, B, or C. Second question. You win $20,000 in the lottery. What do you do with it? Choose from A, B, C, or D above. Most people now take C or D. And of course, by doing so, they exhibit
-  Second question, you win $20,000 in the lottery. What do you do with it? Choose from A, B, C, or D above. Most people now take C or D. And of course, by doing so, they exhibit flawed thinking. You can count it any way you like. $20,000 is still $20,000. We witnessed similar delusions in casinos. A friend places $1,000 on the roulette table and loses everything. When asked about this, he says, I didn't really gamble away $1,000. I won all that earlier. But it's the same amount, not for me. He laughs.

We treat money that we win, discover, or inherit much more frivolously than hard-earned cash. The economist Richard Thaler calls this the house money effect. It leads us to take bigger risks. And for this reason, many lottery winners are not And for this reason, many lottery winners end up worse off after they've cashed in their winnings. That old platitude, win some, lose some, is a feeble attempt to downplay real losses.
-  students opted to risk it. The second group learned they had won nothing, but that they could choose between receiving $30 or taking part in a coin toss in which heads won them $21 and tails secured $39. The second group behaved more conservatively. Only 43% were prepared to gamble, even though the expected value for both options was the same, $30. Gambling strategists recognize the usefulness of the house money effect. Online gambling sites reward you with $100 credit when you sign up. Credit card companies offer the same when you fill in the application form. Airlines present you with a few thousand miles when you join their frequent flyer clubs. Phone companies give you free call credit to get you accustomed to making lots of calls. A large part of the coupon craze stems from the house money effect. In conclusion.
-  The following experiment shows how much effort it takes to question your own theory. A professor presented his students with the number sequence 2-4-6. They had to calculate the underlying rule that the professor had written on the back of a sheet of paper. The students had to provide the next number in the sequence to which the professor would reply fits the rule or does not fit the rule. The students could guess as many numbers as they wanted but could try only once to identify the rule. Most students suggested 8 as the next number and the professor replied fits the rule. To be sure they tried 10, 12, and 14. The professor replied each time fits the rule. Then the students concluded the rule is to add 2 to the last number. The professor shook his head. That is not the rule. One shrewd student tried a different approach. He tested out the number.
-  he convinces himself that there is no point starting until he is in the right mood. Unfortunately, the right mood is a rare occurrence. Another friend has tried to quit smoking every day for the past ten years. Each cigarette is his last. And me? My tax returns have been lying on my desk for six months, waiting to be completed. I haven't yet given up hope that they will fill themselves in. Procrastination is the tendency to delay unpleasant but important acts. The arduous trek to the gym. Switching to a cheaper insurance policy. Writing thank you letters. Even New Year's resolutions won't help you here.

Even New Year's resolutions won't help you here. Procrastination is idiotic because no project completes it.
-  strictly out of bounds. He then left the students alone in the room for thirty minutes. Students in a second group were allowed to eat as many cookies as they wanted. Afterward, both groups had to solve a tough math problem. The students who were forbidden to eat any cookies gave up on the math problem twice as fast as those who were allowed to gorge freely on cookies. The period of self-control had drained their mental energy, or willpower, which they now needed to solve the problem. Willpower is like a battery, at least in the short term. If it's depleted, future challenges will falter. This is a fundamental insight. Self-control
-  The next necessary condition is employing an array of tricks to keep you on the straight and narrow. This includes eliminating distractions. When I write a novel, I turn off my internet access. It's just too enticing to go online when I reach a naughty part. The most effective trick, however, is to set deadlines. Psychologist Dan Ariely found that dates stipulated by external authorities, for example, a teacher or the IRS, work best. Self-imposed deadlines will work only if the task is broken down step by step, with each part assigned its own due date. For this reason, nebulous New Year's resolutions
-  Three scenarios. Which would irk you the most? A. Your friend's salaries increase, yours stays the same. B. Their salaries stay the same, yours is too. C. Their average salaries are cut, yours is too. If you answered A, don't worry, that's perfectly normal. You're just another victim of the green-eyed monster. Here's a Russian fairy tale. A farmer finds a magic lamp. He rubs it, and out of thin air a genie appears who promises to grant him one wish. The farmer thinks about this for a little while. Finally he says,
-  Imagine your colleague scores a big bonus and you get a gift certificate. You feel envy. This creates a chain of irrational behavior. You refuse to help him any longer, sabotage his plans, perhaps even puncture the tires of his Porsche, and you secretly rejoice when he breaks his legs skiing. Of all the emotions, envy is the most idiotic. Why? Because it's relatively easy to switch off. This is in contrast to anger, sadness, or fear. Envy is the most stupid of vices, for there is no single advantage to be gained by it, writes Balzac. In short, envy is the most stupid of vices, for there is no single advantage to be gained by it, writes Balzac.

-  stupid advices, for there is no single advantage to be gained by it," writes Balzac. In short, envy is the most sincere type of flattery. Other than that, it's a waste of time. Many things spark envy. Ownership, status, health, youth, talent, popularity, beauty. It's often confused with jealousy because the physical reactions are identical. The difference? The subject of envy is a thing. Status, money, health, etc. The subject of jealousy is the behavior of a third person. Envy needs two people. Jealousy on the other hand requires three. Peter is jealous of Sam because the beautiful girl next door phones him instead. Paradoxically, envy is a thing.
-  Second, find your circle of competence and fill it in on your own. Create a niche where you are the best. It doesn't matter how small your area of mastery is. The main thing is that you are king of the castle. Like all emotions, envy has its origins in our evolutionary past. If the hominid from the cave next door took a bigger share of the mammoth, it meant less for the loser. Envy motivated us to do something about it. The safe-fare hunter-gatherers disappeared from the gene pool. In extreme cases, they died of starvation, while others feasted. We are the offspring of the envious. But in today's world, envy is no longer vital. If my neighbor buys himself a Porsche, it doesn't mean that he has taken anything from me. When I find myself suffering pangs of envy.
-  others think and feel. Science calls this the theory of mind. Here's an experiment to illustrate it. You are given $100 and must share it with a stranger. You can decide how it's divided up. If the other person is happy with your suggestion, the money will be divided that way. If he or she turns down your offer, you must return the $100 and no one gets anything. How do you split the sum? It would make sense to offer the stranger very little, maybe just a dollar. After all, it's better than nothing. However, in the 1980s, when economists began experimenting with such ultimatum games, the technical term, the subjects behaved very differently. They offered the other party between 30% and 50%. Anything below 30% was considered unfair. The ultimatum game is one of the clearest manifestations of the theory of mind. In short,
-  The student tried all sorts of numbers, minus 24, 9, minus 43. Apparently, he had an idea and he was trying to find a flaw with it. Only when he could no longer find a counter example, the student said, the rule is this, the next number must be higher than the previous one. The professor turned over the sheet of paper, revealing those very words. What distinguished the resourceful student from the others? While the majority of students sought merely to confirm their theories, he tried to find fault with his, consciously looking for disconfirming evidence. You might think, good for him, but not the end of the world for the others. However, falling for the confirmation bias is not a petty intellectual offense. How it affects our lives will be revealed in the next chapter.
-  emaciated child with pleading eyes Afterward people donated an average of two dollars eighty three cents to the charity out of five dollars They were given to fill out a short survey The second group was shown statistics about the famine in Malawi Including the fact that more than three million malnourished children were affected the average donation dropped by 50 percent This is illogical. You would think that people's generosity would grow if they knew the extent of the disaster But we don't function like that Statistics don't stir us people do The media has long known that factual reports and bar charts do not entice readers hence
-  black t-shirts, the other white. The short clip, the monkey business illusion, is available on YouTube. Take a look before reading on. In the video, viewers are asked to count how many times the players in white t-shirts pass the ball. Both teams move in circles, weaving in and out, passing back and forth. Suddenly, in the middle of the video, something bizarre happens. A student dressed as a gorilla walks into the center of the room, pounds his chest, and promptly disappears again. At the end, you're asked if you noticed anything unusual. Half the viewers shake their heads in astonishment. Gorilla? What gorilla?
-  the video, something bizarre happens. A student dressed as a gorilla walks into the center of the room, pounds his chest, and promptly disappears again. At the end you're asked if you noticed anything unusual. Half the viewers shake their heads in astonishment. Gorilla? What gorilla? The monkey business test is considered one of the most famous experiments in psychology and demonstrates the so-called illusion of attention. We're confident that we notice everything that takes place in front of us, but in reality we often see only what we're focusing on. In this case the passes made by the team in white. Unexpected.
-  In contrast, let's define what the gorilla in the room is. A topic that is of the utmost importance and urgency, and that we absolutely need to address, but nobody knows about it. Take the case of Swiss Air, a company that was so fixated on expansion that it overlooked its evaporating liquidity and went bankrupt in 2001. Or the mismanagement in the Eastern Bloc that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Or the risks on banks' books that up until 2007 nobody paid any attention to. Such gorillas stomp around right in front of us and we barely spot them. It's not the case that we miss every single one.
-  perceive everything of importance. Purge yourself of the illusion of attention every now and then. Confront all possible and seemingly impossible scenarios. What unexpected events might happen? What lurks beside and behind the burning issues? What is no one addressing? Pay attention to silences as much as you respond to noises. Check the periphery, not just the center. Think the unthinkable. Something unusual can be huge, we still may not see it. Being big and distinctive is not enough to be seen. The unusual and huge thing must be expected.
-  petty intellectual offense. How it affects our lives will be revealed in the next chapter. 8. Murder Your Darlings. Confirmation Bias, Part 2. In the previous chapter, we met the father of all fallacies, the confirmation bias. Here are a few examples of it. We're forced to establish beliefs about the world, our lives, the economy, investments, our careers, and more. We deal mostly in assumptions, and the more nebulous these are, the stronger the confirmation bias. Whether you go through life believing that people are inherently
-  Suppose you apply for your dream job. You buff your resume to a shine. In the job interview, you highlight your achievements and abilities and gloss over weak points and setbacks. When they ask if you could boost sales by 30% while cutting costs by 30%, you reply in a calm voice, consider it done. Even though you're trembling inside and racking your brain about how the hell you're going to pull that off, you do and say whatever is necessary to get the job. You concentrate on wowing the interviewers. The details will follow. You know that if you give even semi-realistic answers, you'll put
-  He removes his glasses and looks at you. When can I expect the manuscript? Can you have it ready in six months? You gulp. You've never written a book in under three years. Your answer? Consider it done. Of course you don't want to lie, but you know that you won't get the advance if you tell the truth. Once the contract is signed and the money is nestling in your bank account, you can always keep the publisher at bay for a while. You're a writer. You're great at making up stories. The official term for such behavior is strategic misrepresentation. The more at stake, the more exaggerated your assertions become. Strategic misrepresentation is a form of misrepresentation.
-  In the 1980s, Consumer Reports asked experienced tasters to sample 45 different varieties of strawberry jelly. A few years later, psychology professors Timothy Wilson and Jonathan Schuller repeated the experiment with students from the University of Washington. The results were almost identical. Both students and experts preferred the same type. But that was only the first part of Wilson's experiment. He repeated it with a second group of students who, unlike the first group, had to fill in a questionnaire justifying their ratings in detail. The rankings turned out to be completely warped. Some of the best varieties ended up at the bottom of the rankings. Essentially, if you think too much, you cut off your mind from the wisdom of your feelings. This may sound a little esoteric and a bit surprising coming from someone like me.
-  clear, rational thoughts to. They're merely a different form of information processing, more primordial, but not necessarily an inferior variant. In fact, sometimes they provide the wiser counsel. This raises the question, when do you listen to your head and when do you heed your gut? A rule of thumb might be, if it's something to do with practiced activities, such as motor skills, think of the centipede, van de Velde, or mastering a musical instrument, or questions you've answered a thousand times, think of Warren Buffett's circle of competence, it's better not to reflect to the less detail. It undermines your intuitive ability to solve
-  answered a thousand times, think of Warren Buffett's circle of competence, it's better not to reflect to the last detail. It undermines your intuitive ability to solve problems. The same applies to decisions that our Stone Age ancestors faced, evaluating what was edible, who would make good friends, whom to trust. For such purposes, we have heuristics, mental shortcuts that are clearly superior to rational thought. With complex matters though, such as investment decisions, sober reflection is indispensable. Evolution has not equipped us for such considerations, so logic trumps intuition.
-  The students had to specify two submission dates. The first was a realistic deadline and the second was a worst-case scenario date. The result? Only 30% of students made the realistic deadlines. On average, the students needed 50% more time than planned and a full seven days more than their worst-case scenario date. The planning fallacy is particularly evident when people work together in business, science, and politics. Groups overestimate duration and benefits and systematically underestimate costs and risks. The conch-shaped Sydney Opera House was planned in 1957.

The planning fallacy is particularly evident when people work together, in business, science, and politics. Groups overestimate duration and benefits and systematically underestimate costs and risks. The conch-shaped Sydney Opera House was planned in 1957. Completion was due in 1963 at a cost of $7 million. It finally opened its doors in 1973 after $102 million had been pumped in, 14 times the original estimate. So why are we not natural-born planners? The first reason, wishful thinking.
-  for a house lands on your desk and must be discussed urgently. There goes the plan. If you plan things even more minutely, would that be a solution? No. Step-by-step preparation amplifies the planning fallacy. It narrows your focus even more and thus distracts you even more from anticipating the unexpected. So what can you do? Shift your focus from internal things, such as your own project, to external factors like similar projects. Look at the base rate and consult the past. If other ventures of the same type lasted three years and devoured five million dollars, this will probably apply to your project too.

As a banker, you believe an error took place in the loan department. As a socialist, you blame the failure of capitalism. As a religious conservative, you see in this a punishment from God. As a psychiatrist, you recognize low serotonin levels. Which is the correct viewpoint? None of them.

Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's business partner, named the effect the man with the hammer tendency after Twain. But that's a perfectly disastrous way to think and a perfectly disastrous way to operate in the world. So you've got to have multiple models and the models have to come from multiple disciplines because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department. Here are a few examples of deformation
-  the man with the hammer tends to overuse it. Literary reviewers are trained to detect authors' references, symbols, and hidden messages. As a novelist, I realized that literary reviewers conjure up such devices where there are none. This is not a million miles away from what business journalists do, too. They scour the most trivial utterings of central bank governors and somehow discover hints of fiscal policy change by parsing their words. In conclusion, if you take your problem to an expert, don't expect the overall best solution. Expect an approach that can be solved with the expert's toolkit. The brain is not a central computer.

-  pocket knives are incomplete. Given our life experiences and our professional expertise, we already possess a few blades. But to better equip ourselves, we must try to add two or three additional tools to our repertoire. Mental models that are far afield from our areas of expertise. For example, over the past few years, I've begun to take a biological view of the world and have won a new understanding of complex systems. Locate your shortcomings and find suitable knowledge and methodologies to balance them. It takes about a year to internalize the most important ideas of a new field and it's worth it. Your pocket knife will be bigger.

How can you have forgotten, she asks indignantly, especially with your super memory. The waiter replies curtly, I keep every order in my head until it's served. Zagarnick and her mentor, Kurt Lewin, studied this strange behavior and found that all people function more or less like the waiter. We seldom forget uncompleted tasks. They persist in our consciousness and do not let up, tugging at us like little children until we give them our attention. On the other hand.

Only in recent years could Roy Baumeister and his research team at Florida State University shed light on this. He took students who were a few months away from their final examinations and split them into three groups. Group one had to focus on a party during the current semester. Group two had to concentrate on the exam. Group three had to focus on the exam and also create a detailed study plan. Then Baumeister asked students to complete words under time pressure. Some students saw P.A. and filled in panic, while others thought of party or Paris. This was a clever method of finding out what was on each of their minds. As expected, group one had relaxed about the upcoming exam, while students in group one
-  on each of their minds. As expected, Group 1 had relaxed about the upcoming exam, while students in Group 2 could think of nothing else. Most astonishing was the result from Group 3. Although these students also had to focus on the upcoming exam, their minds were clear and free from anxiety. Further experiments confirmed this. Outstanding tasks gnaw at us only until we have a clear idea of how we'll deal with them. We mistakenly believed that it was necessary to complete tasks to erase them from memory. But it's not. A good plan of action suffices. David Allen, the
-  until we have a clear idea of how we'll deal with them. Zygarnik mistakenly believed that it was necessary to complete tasks to erase them from memory, but it's not a good plan of action suffices. David Allen, the author of a bestselling book aptly entitled Getting Things Done, argues that he has one goal to have a head as clear as water. For this, you don't need to have your whole life sorted into tidy compartments. But it does mean that you need a detailed plan for dealing with the messier areas. This plan must be divided into step by step tasks and preferably written down. Only when this is done can your mind rest.
-  This plan must be divided into step-by-step tasks and preferably written down. Only when this is done can your mind rest. The adjective detailed is important. Organize my wife's birthday party or find a new job are worthless. Alan forces his clients to split such projects into 20 to 50 individual tasks. It's worth noting that Alan's recommendation seems to fly in the face of the planning fallacy, Chapter 91. The more detailed our planning, the more we tend to overlook factors from the periphery that will derail our projects. But here's the rub. If you want peace of mind, go for Alan's approach. If you want the most accurate estimate on cost, benefit, and duration of a project, forget your detailed plan and look up similar projects. If you want both, do both. Fortunately, you can do all this yourself.
-  Specifically, he calculated the correlation of the rankings between year one and year two, between year one and year three, year one and year four, up until year seven and year eight. The result? Pure coincidence. Sometimes the advisor was at the very top and sometimes the very bottom. If an advisor had a great year, this was neither bolstered by previous years nor carried into subsequent years. The correlation was zero. And yet, the consultants pocketed bonuses for their performance. In other words, the company was rewarding luck rather than skill. In conclusion, certain people make a living
-  The correlation was zero, and yet the consultants pocketed bonuses for their performance. In other words, the company was rewarding luck rather than skill. In conclusion, certain people make a living from their abilities, such as pilots, plumbers, and lawyers. In other areas, skill is necessary but not critical, as with entrepreneurs and leaders. Finally, chance is the deciding factor in a number of fields, such as in financial markets. Here, the illusion of skill pervades. So give plumbers due respect and chuckle at successful financial jesters.
-  features in each of them. Now examine Series B, 349-851-274-905-772-032-854-113. What links each of these numbers? Do not read further until you figured it out. Series B is more difficult, right? Answer, none use the number 6. What can you learn from this? Absence is much harder to detect than presence. In other words, we place greater emphasis on what's present than on what's absent. Last week, while on a walk, it occurred.
-  A classical recital and orchestra perform Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. A storm of enthusiasm gripped the concert hall. During the ode in the fourth movement, tears of joy could be seen here and there. How fortunate we are that this symphony exists, I thought. But is that really true? Would we be less happy without the work? Probably not. Had the symphony never been composed, no one would miss it. The director would receive no angry calls saying, Please have this symphony written and performed immediately. In short, what exists means a lot more than what is missing. Science calls this the feature positive effect.

In academia we constantly encounter the feature positive effect. The confirmation of hypotheses leads to publications and in exceptional cases these are rewarded with Nobel prizes.

And as far as I know, there's never been a Nobel prize awarded for this. However, such falsification is as scientifically valuable as confirmation. Another consequence of the effect is that we're also much more open to positive advice. Do X than to negative suggestions. Forget about Y. No matter how useful the latter may be.
-  In conclusion, we have problems perceiving non-events. We're blind to what does not exist. We realize if there's a war, but we don't appreciate the absence of war during peacetime. If we're healthy, we rarely think about being sick. Or if we get off the plane in Cancun, we don't stop to notice that we didn't crash. If we thought more frequently about absence, we might well be happier. But it's tough mental work. The greatest philosophical question is, why does something and not nothing exist? Don't expect a quick answer. Rather, the question itself represents a useful instrument for combating the feature positive effect.
-  cherry. Right, close to zero. To rebuff an anecdote is difficult because it's a mini story, and we know how vulnerable our brains are to those. To prevent this, cunning leaders train themselves throughout their careers to be hypersensitive to such anecdotes and to shoot them down as soon as they're uttered. The more elevated or elite a field is, the more we fall for cherry picking. In Anti-Fragile, Taleb describes how all areas of research, from philosophy to medicine to economics, brag about the results. Like politicians, academia is well equipped to tell us what it did for us, not what it did not. It
-  The Internet is particularly fertile ground for the confirmation bias. To stay informed, we browse new sites and blogs, forgetting that our favored pages mirror our existing values, be they liberal, conservative, or somewhere in between. Moreover, a lot of sites now tailor content to personal interests and browsing history, causing new and divergent opinions to vanish from the radar altogether. We inevitably land in communities of like-minded people, further reinforcing our convictions and the confirmation bias. Literary critic Arthur Quiller Couch had a memorable motto,
-  we fall for cherry picking. In Anti-Fragile, Taleb describes how all areas of research, from philosophy to medicine to economics, brag about their results. Like politicians, academia is well-equipped to tell us what it did for us, not what it did not. Hence, it shows how indispensable her methods are. Pure cherry picking. But our respect for academics is far too great for us to notice this. Or consider the medical profession, to tell people that they should not smoke is the greatest medical contribution of the past 60 years, superior to all the research and medical advances since the end of the Second World War.
-  taking the medicine. A few cherries, antibiotics for instance, distract us and so drug researchers are celebrated while anti-smoking activists are not. Administrative departments in large companies glorify themselves like hoteliers do. They're masters at showcasing all they've done but they never communicate what they haven't achieved for the company. What should you do? If you sit on the supervisory board of such an organization, ask about the leftover cherries, the failed projects and missed goals. You'll learn a lot more from this than from the successes. It's amazing how seldom such questions are asked.

-  the worldwide success of a company, the invention of writing. Any clear thinking person knows that no single factor leads to such events. Rather, there are hundreds, thousands, and infinite number of factors that add up. Still, we keep trying to pin the blame on just one. When an apple ripens and falls, what makes it fall? It's that it's attracted to the ground. It's that the stem withers. It's that the sun has dried it up. That it's grown heavier. That the wind shakes it. That the boy standing underneath it wants to eat it. No one thing is the cause. In this passage from War and Peace, Tolstoy hits the ground.

Suppose you're the product manager for a well-known breakfast cereal brand. You've just launched an organic, lower sugar variety. After a month, it's painfully clear that the new product is a flop. How do you go about investigating the cause? First, you know that there will never be one sole factor. Take a sheet of paper.

Third, conduct empirical tests by varying the highlighted factors in different markets. This costs time and money, but it's the only way to escape the swamp of superficial assumptions. The fallacy of the single cause is as ancient as it is dangerous. We've learned to see people as the masters of their own destiny.
-  their own destinies. Aristotle proclaimed this 2,500 years ago. Today we know that it's wrong. The notion of free will is up for debate. Our actions are brought about by the interaction of thousands of factors, from genetic predisposition to upbringing, from education to the concentration of hormones between individual brain cells. Still we hold firmly to the old image of self-governance. This is not only wrong but also morally questionable. As long as we believe in singular reasons, we'll always be able to trace triumphs or disasters back to individuals and stamp them responsible.
-  Literary critic Arthur Quiller Couch had a memorable motto, murder your darlings. This was his advice to writers who struggled with cutting, cherished, but redundant sentences. Quiller Couch's appeal is not just for hesitant hacks, but for all of us who suffer from the deafening silence of ascent. To fight against the confirmation bias, try writing down your beliefs, whether in terms of worldview, investments, marriage, health care, diet, career strategies, and set out to find disconfirming evidence. Axing beliefs that feel like old friends is hard work, but imperative.
-  beach is around 75 miles. Drivers who cover the distance in an hour or less will categorize as reckless drivers because they're traveling at an average of 75 miles per hour or more. All others we put into the group of careful drivers. Which group experiences fewer accidents? Without a doubt it's the reckless drivers. They all completed the journey in less than an hour so they couldn't have been involved in any accidents. This automatically puts all drivers who end up in accidents in the slower drivers category. This example illustrates a treacherous fallacy, the so-called intention to treat error. Unfortunately there is no catchier term for it.
-  vehemently insisted that every company should borrow at will, and of course, his bank is the best place to do it. I examined the study more closely. How could that be? Indeed, from 1,000 randomly selected firms, those with large loans displayed higher returns not only on their equity, but also on their total capital. They were in every respect more successful than the independently financed firms. Then the penny dropped. Unprofitable companies don't get corporate loans. Thus, they form part of the equity-only group. The other firms that make up this set have bigger cash cushions, stay afloat longer, and no matter how sickly they are, they are not going to be able to pay their loans.
-  Okay, got it. Watch out. The intention to treat error is not easy to recognize. A fictional example from medicine. A pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug to fight heart disease. A study proves that it significantly reduces patients' mortality rates. The data speaks for itself. Among patients who have taken the drug regularly, the five-year mortality rate is 15 percent. For those who have swallowed placebo pills, it's about the same, indicating that the pill doesn't work. However, and this is crucial, the mortality rate of patients who have taken the drug at irregular intervals is 30 percent, twice as high.
-  who have taken the drug at irregular intervals is 30%, twice as high. A big difference between regular and irregular intake. So the pill is a complete success. Or is it? Here's the snag. The pill is probably not the decisive factor. Rather, it's the patient's behavior. Perhaps patients discontinued the pill following severe side effects and thus landed in the irregular intake category. Maybe they were so ill that there was no way to continue it on a regular basis. Either way, only relatively healthy patients remain in the regular group, which makes the drug look a lot more effective than it really is.
-  patients discontinued the pill following severe side effects and thus landed in the irregular intake category. Maybe they were so ill that there was no way to continue it on a regular basis. Either way, only relatively healthy patients remain in the regular group, which makes the drug look a lot more effective than it really is. The really sick patients, who for this very reason couldn't take the drug on a regular basis, ended up populating the irregular intake group. In reputable studies, medical researchers evaluate the data of all patients whom they originally intend to treat, hence the title. It doesn't matter if they take part in the trial or they drop out.
-  where it belongs in the trash can. 99. Why you shouldn't read the news. News Illusion. Earthquake in Sumatra. Plane crash in Russia. Man holds daughter captive in cellar for 30 years. Heidi Klum separates from seal. Record salaries at Bank of America. Attack in Pakistan. Resignation of Mali's president. New world record in shot put. Do you really need to know all these things? We are incredibly well informed, yet we know incredibly little. Why? Because two centuries ago we invented a toxic form of knowledge called news. News is to the mind what sugar is to the body. Appetizing, easy to digest, and highly destructive in the long run.
-  Axing beliefs that feel like old friends is hard work, but imperative. 9. Don't bow to authority. Authority bias The first book of the Bible explains what happens when we disobey a great authority. We get ejected from paradise. This is also what less celestial authorities would have us believe. Appundance, scientists, doctors, CEOs, economists, government heads, sports commentators, consultants, and stock market gurus. Authorities pose two main problems to clear thinking.
-  friends and acquaintances, work as a news filter and keeps me in the loop. A dozen reasons exist to give news a wide berth. Here are the top three. First, our brains react disproportionately to different types of information. Scandalous, shocking, people-based, loud, fast-changing details all stimulate us, whereas abstract, complex, and unprocessed information sedates us. News producers capitalize on this. Gripping stories, garish images, and sensational facts capture our attention. Recall for a moment their business models. Advertisers buy space and thus finance it.
-  Gripping stories, garish images, and sensational facts capture our attention. Recall for a moment their business models. Advertisers buy space and thus finance the news circus on the condition that their ads will be seen. The result? Everything subtle, complex, abstract, and profound must be systematically filtered out, even though such stories are much more relevant to our lives and to our understanding of the world. As a result of news consumption, we walk around with a distorted mental map of the risks and threats we actually face. Second, news is irrelevant. In the past 12 months, you've probably consumed about
-  Everything subtle, complex, abstract, and profound must be systematically filtered out, even though such stories are much more relevant to our lives and to our understanding of the world. As a result of news consumption, we walk around with a distorted mental map of the risks and threats we actually face. Second, news is irrelevant. In the past 12 months, you've probably consumed about 10,000 news snippets, perhaps as many as 30 per day. Be very honest. Name one of them, just one that helped you make a better decision for your life, your career, or your business, compared with not having this piece of news. No one I know
-  Be very honest. Name one of them. Just one that helped you make a better decision for your life, your career, or your business, compared with not having this piece of news. No one, I have asked, has been able to name more than two useful news stories out of 10,000. A miserable result. News organizations assert that their information gives you a competitive advantage. Too many fall for this. In reality, news consumption represents a competitive disadvantage. If news really helped people advance, journalists would be at the top of the income pyramid. They aren't. Quite the opposite.

In reality, news consumption represents a competitive disadvantage. If news really helped people advance, journalists would be at the top of the income pyramid. They aren't. Quite the opposite. Third, news is a waste of time. An average human being squanders half a day each week on reading about current affairs. In global terms, this is an immense loss of productivity. Take the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai. Out of sheer thirst for recognition, terrorists
-  Terrorists murdered 200 people. Let's say a billion people devoured an hour of their time to following the aftermath. They viewed the minute-by-minute updates and listened to the inane chatter of a few experts and commentators. This is a very realistic guesstimate since India has more than a billion inhabitants. Thus, our conservative calculation? One billion people multiplied by an hour's distraction equals one billion hours of work stoppage. If we convert this, we learn that news consumption wasted around 2,000 lives. Ten times more than the attack. A sarcastic but accurate observation. I would predict that
-  Thus, our conservative calculation? One billion people multiplied by an hour's distraction equals one billion hours of work stoppage. If we convert this, we learn that news consumption wasted around 2,000 lives. Ten times more than the attack. A sarcastic but accurate observation. I would predict that turning your back on news will benefit you as much as purging any of the other 98 flaws we've covered in the pages of this book. Kick the habit. Completely. Instead, read long background articles and books. Yes, nothing beats books for understanding the world.
-  The Pope asked Michelangelo, tell me the secret of your genius. How have you created the statue of David, the masterpiece of all masterpieces? Michelangelo's answer, it's simple. I removed everything that is not David. Let's be honest. We don't know for sure what makes us successful. We can't pinpoint exactly what makes us happy. But we know with certainty what destroys success or happiness. This realization, as simple as it is, is fundamental. Negative knowledge, what not to do, is much more potent than positive knowledge, what to do. Thinking more clearly and acting more shrewdly means adopting Michelangelo's method. Don't focus on David. Instead, focus on yourself.
-  I've listed almost 100 thinking errors in this book without answering the question, what are thinking errors anyway? What is irrationality? Why do we fall into these traps? Two theories of irrationality exist, a hot and a cold. The hot theory is as old as the hills. Here is Plato's analogy. A rider steers wildly galloping horses. The rider signifies reason and the galloping horses embody emotions. Reason tames feelings. If this fails, irrationality runs free. Another example, feelings are like bubbling lava. Usually reason can keep a little bit of water in the water.
-  Galloping horses embody emotions. Reason tames feelings. If this fails, irrationality runs free. Another example, feelings are like bubbling lava. Usually reason can keep a lid on them, but every now and then the lava of irrationality erupts, hence hot irrationality. There's no reason to fret about logic. It's error-free. It's just that sometimes emotions overpower it. This hot theory of irrationality boiled and bubbled for centuries. For John Calvin, the founder of a strict form of Protestantism in the 1500s, such feelings represented evil, and only by focusing on the
-  The result was a cold theory of irrationality that states, thinking is in itself not pure, but prone to error. This affects everyone. Even highly intelligent people fall into the same cognitive traps. Likewise, errors are not randomly distributed. We systematically err in the same direction. That makes our mistakes predictable and thus fixable to a degree, but only to a degree, never completely. For a few decades, the origins of these errors remained in the dark. Everything else in our body is relatively reliable. Heart, muscles, lungs, immune system.
-  Thinking is a biological phenomenon. Evolution has shaped it just as it has the forms of animals or the colors of flowers. Suppose we could go back 50,000 years, grab hold of an ancestor, and bring him back with us into the present. We send him to the hairdresser and put him in a Hugo Boss suit. Would he stand out on the street? No. Of course he would have to learn English, how to drive, and how to operate a cell phone, but we had to learn those things too. Biology has dispelled all doubt. Physically, and that includes cognitively, we are hunter-gatherers in Hugo Boss. Or H&M, as the case may be.

Physically, and that includes cognitively, we are hunter-gatherers in Hugo Boss, or H&M as the case may be. What has changed markedly since ancient times is the environment in which we live. Back then, things were simple and stable. We lived in small groups of about 50 people. There was no significant technological or social progress. Only in the last 10,000 years, we have been able to live in a society where we are able to do what we want. We have been able to live in a society where we are able to do what we want.

-  or H&M as the case may be. What has changed markedly since ancient times is the environment in which we live. Back then things were simple and stable. We lived in small groups of about 50 people. There was no significant technological or social progress. Only in the last 10,000 years did the world begin to transform dramatically with the development of crops, livestock, villages, cities, global trade and financial markets. Since industrialization little is left of the environment for which our brain is optimized. If you spend 15 minutes in a shopping mall you'll pass more people than our ancestors saw during the last century.
-  Whoever claims to know how the world will look in 10 years is made into a laughing stock less than a year after such a pronouncement. In the past 10,000 years, we've created a world that we no longer understand. Everything is more sophisticated, but also more complex and interdependent. The result is overwhelming material prosperity, but also lifestyle diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, lung cancer and depression, and errors in thinking. If the complexity continues to rise, and it will, that much is certain. These errors will only increase and intensify. In our hunter-gatherer past, we have seen the world change.
-  If your hunter-gatherer buddies suddenly bolted, it made sense to follow suit, regardless of whether a saber-toothed tiger or a boar had startled them. If you failed to run away and it turned out to be a tiger, the price of first-degree error was death. On the other hand, if you had just fled from a boar, this lesser mistake would have cost you only a few calories. It paid to be wrong about the same things. Whoever was wired differently exited the gene pool after the first or second incidents. We are the descendants of those hominÃ©s sapientes who tend to flee when the crowd does.
-  Perhaps every candy bar in a brown wrapper must be a Hershey bar. Even intelligent people are susceptible to this flawed conclusion. So are native tribes that for the most part remain untouched by civilization. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors were certainly not impervious to faulty logic. Some bugs in our thinking are hardwired and have nothing to do with the mutation of our environment. Why is that? Evolution doesn't optimize us completely. As long as we advance beyond our competitors, namely beat the Neanderthals, we can get away with error-laced behavior. Consider the cuckoo. For hundreds of thousands of years, they have laid the groundwork for the evolution of our environment.
-  For hundreds of thousands of years, they have laid their eggs in the nests of songbirds, which then incubate and even feed the cuckoo chicks. This represents a behavioral error that evolution has not erased from the smaller birds. It's not deemed to be serious enough. A second parallel explanation of why our mistakes are so persistent took shape in the late 1990s. Our brains are designed to reproduce rather than search for the truth. In other words, we use our thoughts primarily to persuade. Whoever convinces others secures power and thus access to resources. Such assets represent a major advantage for mating and for rearing offspring.
-  In other words, we use our thoughts primarily to persuade. Whoever convinces others secures power and thus access to resources. Such assets represent a major advantage for mating and for rearing offspring. The truth is, at best, a secondary focus and is reflected in the book market. Novels sell much better than non-fiction titles in spite of the latter's superior candor. Finally, a third explanation exists. Intuitive decisions, even if they lack logic, are better under certain circumstances. So-called heuristic research deals with this topic. For many decisions, we lack the ability to make decisions.
-  Finally, a third explanation exists. Intuitive decisions, even if they lack logic, are better under certain circumstances. So-called heuristic research deals with this topic. For many decisions, we lack the necessary information. So we're forced to use mental shortcuts and rules of thumb, heuristics. If you're drawn to different potential romantic partners, you must evaluate whom to marry. This is not a rational decision. If you rely solely on logic, you'll remain single forever. In short, we often decide intuitively and justify our choices later. Many decisions, career, life partner,

If you rely solely on logic, you'll remain single forever. In short, we often decide intuitively and justify our choices later. Many decisions, career, life partner, investments, take place subconsciously. A fraction of a second later, we construct a reason so that we feel we made a conscious choice. Alas, we don't behave like scientists who are purely interested in objective facts.
-  choice. Alas, we don't behave like scientists who are purely interested in objective facts. Instead, we think like lawyers, crafting the best possible justification for a predetermined conclusion. So forget about the left and right brain that semi-intelligent self-help books describe. Much more important is the difference between intuitive and rational thinking. Both have legitimate applications. The intuitive mind is swift, spontaneous, and energy-saving. Rational thinking is slow, demanding, and energy-guzzling, in the form of blood sugar. Nobody has the ability to do so.
-  Much more important is the difference between intuitive and rational thinking. Both have legitimate applications. The intuitive mind is swift, spontaneous, and energy-saving. Rational thinking is slow, demanding, and energy-guzzling, in the form of blood sugar. Nobody has described this better than the great Daniel Kahneman in Thinking Fast and Slow. Since I started to collect cognitive errors, people often ask me how I manage to live an error-free life. The answer is, I don't. In fact, I don't even try. Just like everybody else, I make snap decisions by consulting not my thoughts, but my feelings.
-  I have set myself the following rules in situations where the possible consequences are large Namely important personal or business decisions. I try to be as reasonable and rational as possible when choosing I take out my list of errors and check them off one by one just like a pilot does I've created a handy checklist decision tree and I use it to examine important decisions with a fine-tooth comb In situations where the consequences are small namely regular or diet Pepsi Sparkling or flat water.

-  I've created a handy checklist decision tree, and I use it to examine important decisions with a fine-tooth comb. In situations where the consequences are small, namely regular or diet Pepsi, sparkling or flat water, I forget about rational optimization and let my intuition take over. Thinking is tiring. Therefore, if the potential harm is small, don't rack your brains. Such errors won't do lasting damage. You'll live better like this. Nature doesn't seem to mind if our decisions are perfect or not, as long as we can maneuver ourselves through life, and as long as we're ready to be rational when it comes to the crunch.
-  If your arm is small, don't rack your brains. Such errors won't do lasting damage. You'll live better like this. Nature doesn't seem to mind if our decisions are perfect or not, as long as we can maneuver ourselves through life, and as long as we're ready to be rational when it comes to the crunch. And there's one other area where I let my intuition take the lead, when I'm in my circle of competence. If you practice an instrument, you learn the notes and tell your fingers how to play them. Over time, you know the keys or the strings inside out. You see a musical score, and your hands play the notes almost automatically. Warren Buffett reads balance sheets all the time.

This is his circle of competence, the field he intuitively understands and masters. So find out where your circle of competence is. Get a clear grasp of it. Hint, it's smaller than you think.

-  In reality, no electrical current was actually flowing. Milgram used an actor to play the role of the victim. But those charged with administering the shocks didn't know that. The results were, well, shocking. As the person in the other room wailed and writhed in pain, and the subject administering the shock wanted to stop, the professor would say, keep going, the experiment depends on it. The majority of people continued with the electrocution. More than half of the participants went all the way up to the maximum voltage, out of sheer obedience to authority.
-  the dangers of the authority bias. In the old days, the captain was king. His commands were not to be doubted. If a co-pilot suspected an oversight, he wouldn't have dared to address it out of respect for, or fear of, his captain. Since this behavior was discovered, nearly every airline has instituted Crew Resource Management, CRM, which coaches pilots and their crews to discuss any reservations they have openly and quickly. In other words, they carefully deprogram the authority bias. CRM has contributed more to flight safety in the past 20 years than have any technical advances.
-  where employees are likely to keep their lesser opinions to themselves, much to the detriment of the business. Authorities crave recognition and constantly find ways to reinforce their status. Doctors and researchers sport white coats. Bank directors don suits and ties. Kings wear crowns. Members of the military wield rank badges. Today, even more symbols and props are used to signal expertise. Appearances on talk shows and on the covers of magazines, to book tours and Wikipedia entries. Authority changes, much like fashion does, and society follows it just as it does.

Contrast Effect In his book Influence, Robert Cialdini tells the story of two brothers, Sid and Harry, who ran a clothing store in 1930s America. Sid was in charge of sales and Harry led the tailoring department. Whenever Sid noticed that the customers who stood before the mirror really liked their suits, he became a little hard of hearing. He called to his brother, Harry, how much for this suit? Harry looked up from his computer.
-  Take two buckets, fill the first with lukewarm water and the second with ice water. Dip your right hand into the ice water for one minute. Then put both hands into the lukewarm water. What do you notice? The lukewarm water feels as it should to the left hand and piping hot to the right hand. Both of these stories epitomize the contrast effect. We judge something to be beautiful, expensive, or large if we have something ugly, cheap, or small in front of us. We have difficulty with absolute judgments. The contrast effect is a common misconception. You order leather seats for your new car because compared to the $60,000 price tag on the car, $3,000 seems a pittance. All industries that are in the market are the same.

-  investor told me the share is a great value because it's 50% below the peak price. I shook my head. A share price is never low or high it is what it is and the only thing that matters is whether it goes up or down from that point. When we encounter contrasts we react like birds to a gunshot. We jump up and get moving. Our weak spot we don't notice small gradual changes. A magician can make your watch vanish because when he presses on one part of your body you don't notice the lighter touch on your wrist as he relieves you of your Rolex. Similarly we fail to notice how our money disappears.
-  attractive than you really are. Go alone, or better yet, take two ugly friends. 11, why we prefer a wrong map to none at all. Availability bias. Smoking can't be that bad for you. My grandfather smoked three packs of cigarettes a day and lived to be more than 100. Or Manhattan is really safe. I know someone who lives in the middle of the village and never locks his door, not even when he goes on vacation. And his apartment has never been broken into. We use statements like these to try to prove something, but they actually prove.
-  and he never locks his door, not even when he goes on vacation, and his apartment has never been broken into. We use statements like these to try to prove something, but they actually prove nothing at all. When we speak like this, we succumb to the availability bias. Are there more English words that start with a K or more words with K as its third letter? Answer. More than twice as many English words have K in the third position than start with a K. Why do most people believe the opposite is true? Because we can think of words beginning with a K more quickly. They're more available to our memory.
-  beginning with a K, more quickly. They're more available to our memory. The availability bias says this. We create a picture of the world using the examples that most easily come to mind. This is idiotic, of course, because in reality things don't happen more frequently just because we can conceive of them more easily. Thanks to the availability bias, we travel through life with an incorrect risk map in our heads. Thus, we systematically overestimate the risk of being the victims of a plane crash, a car accident or a murder. And we underestimate the risk of dying from less spectacular means, such as diabetes or stomach cancer.
-  The availability bias has an established seat at the corporate board's table, too. Board members discuss what management has submitted, usually quarterly figures, instead of more important things such as a clever move by the competition, a slump in employee motivation, or an unexpected change in customer behavior. They tend not to discuss what's not on the agenda. In addition, people prefer information that's easy to obtain, be it economic data or recipes. They make decisions based on this information, rather than on more relevant but harder to obtain information, often with disastrous results.
-  or recipes. They make decisions based on this information rather than on more relevant but harder to obtain information, often with disastrous results. For example, we've known for 10 years that the so-called black shoeless formula for the pricing of derivative financial products does not work, but we don't have another solution, so we carry on with an incorrect tool. It's as if you were in a foreign city without a map and then pulled out one for your hometown and simply use that. We prefer wrong information to no information. Thus, the availability bias has presented the banks with billions in losses.
-  in a foreign city without a map and then pulled out one for your hometown and simply use that. We prefer wrong information to no information. Thus, the availability bias has presented the banks with billions in losses. What was it that Frank Sinatra sang? Something about loving the girl I'm near when I'm not near the girl I love? A perfect example of the availability bias. End it off by spending time with people who think differently than you do. People whose experiences and expertise are different from yours. We require others' input to overcome the availability bias.

A few years ago I was on vacation in Corsica and fell sick. The symptoms were new to me and the pain was growing by the day. Eventually I decided to seek help at a local clinic. A young doctor began to inspect me, prodding my stomach, gripping my shoulders and knees, and then poking each vertebra. I began to suspect that he had no idea what my problem was.
-  A young doctor began to inspect me, prodding my stomach, gripping my shoulders and knees, and then poking each vertebra. I began to suspect that he had no idea what my problem was, but I wasn't really sure, so I simply endured the strange examination. To signal its end, he pulled out his notebook and said, antibiotics, take one tablet three times a day, it'll get worse before it gets better. Glad that I now had a treatment, I dragged myself back to my hotel room with the prescription in my hand. The pain grew worse and worse, just as the doctor had predicted. The doctor must have known what was wrong with me after all. But
-  the prescription in my hand. The pain grew worse and worse, just as the doctor had predicted. The doctor must have known what was wrong with me after all. But when the pain hadn't subsided after three days, I called him. Increase the dose to five times a day. It's going to hurt for a while more, he said. After two more days of agony, I finally called the International Air Ambulance. The Swiss doctor diagnosed appendicitis and operated on me immediately. Why did you wait so long? He asked me after the surgery. I replied, it all happened exactly as the doctor said, so I trusted him.
-  without a trace. In his desperation, he hires a consultant. For $5,000 a day, this man analyzes the company and comes back with his findings. Your sales department has no vision, and your brand isn't positioned clearly. It's a tricky situation. I can fix it for you, but not overnight. The measures will require sensitivity, and most likely sales will fall further before things improve. The CEO hires the consultant. A year later, sales fall, and the same thing happens the next year. Again and again, the consultant stresses that the company's progress corresponds closely to his prediction. As
-  but not overnight. The measures will require sensitivity, and most likely sales will fall further before things improve. The CEO hires the consultant. A year later, sales fall, and the same thing happens the next year. Again and again, the consultant stresses that the company's progress corresponds closely to his prediction. As sales continue their slump in the third year, the CEO fires the consultant. A mere smoke screen, the it'll get worse before it gets better fallacy, is a variant of the so-called confirmation bias. If the problem continues to worsen, the prediction is confirmed.
-  strategy success is the religious zealot who believes that before we can experience heaven on earth the world must be destroyed. Disasters, floods, fires, death, they're all part of the larger plan and must take place. These believers will view any deterioration of the situation as confirmation of the prophecy and any improvement as a gift from God. In conclusion, if someone says it'll get worse before it gets better, you should hear alarm bells ringing. But beware, situations do exist where things first dip, then improve. For example, a career change requires time and often incorporates loss of pay.
-  deterioration of the situation as confirmation of the prophecy and any improvement as a gift from God. In conclusion, if someone says it'll get worse before it gets better, you should hear alarm bells ringing. But beware, situations do exist where things first dip then improve. For example, a career change requires time and often incorporates loss of pay. The reorganization of a business also takes time. But in all these cases, we can see relatively quickly if the measures are working. The milestones are clear and verifiable. Look to these rather than to the heavens.
-  The milestones are clear and verifiable. Look to these rather than to the heavens. 13. Even true stories are fairy tales. Story Bias Life is a muddle, as intricate as a Gordian knot. Imagine an invisible Martian decides to follow you around with an equally invisible notebook, recording what you do, think, and dream. The rundown of your life would consist of entries such as drank coffee, two sugars, stepped on a thumbtack and swore like a sailor, dreamed that I kissed the neighbor, booked a
-  loose monetary policy created the collapse of Lehman Brothers. We comprehend why the Iron Curtain had to fall, or why Harry Potter became a best seller. Here we speak about understanding. But these things cannot be understood in the traditional sense. We simply build the meaning into them afterward. Stories are dubious entities. They simplify and distort reality and filter things that don't fit. But apparently, we can't do without them. Why remains unclear. What is clear is that people first use stories to explain the world before they began to think scientifically, making mythology older than philosophy. This has led to the story bias. In the media, story bias rages like a wildfire. For example, a car is driving by.
-  inevitably leads us to take bigger risks and urges us to take a stroll on thin ice. 14, why you should keep a diary, hindsight bias. I came across the diaries of my great uncle recently. In 1932, he emigrated from a tiny Swiss village to Paris to seek his fortune in the movie industry. In August 1940, two months after Paris was occupied, he noted,
-  occupied, he noted, everyone is certain that the Germans will leave by the end of the year. Their officers also confirmed this to me. England will fall as fast as France did, and then we'll finally have our Parisian lives back, albeit as part of Germany. The occupation lasted four years. In today's history books, the German occupation of France seems to form part of a clear military strategy. In retrospect, the actual course of the war appears the most likely of all scenarios. Why? Because we have fallen victim to the hindsight bias. Let's take a more recent example. In 2007, economic experts
-  In retrospect, the actual course of the war appears the most likely of all scenarios. Why? Because we have fallen victim to the hindsight bias. Let's take a more recent example. In 2007, economic experts painted a rosy picture for the coming years. However, just 12 months later, the financial markets imploded. Asked about the crisis, the same experts enumerated its causes. In hindsight, the reasons for the crash seem painfully obvious. The hindsight bias is one of the most prevailing fallacies of all. We can aptly describe it as the I told you so phenomenon. In retrospect, everything seems clear and inevitable. If a CEO becomes successful due to a lack of capital, the company will be able to make a profit. The company will be able to make a profit. If a CEO becomes successful due to a lack of capital,
-  One particularly blundering example, nowadays it seems tragic yet completely plausible that a single shot in Sarajevo in 1914 would totally upturn the world for 30 years and cost 50 million lives. Every child learns this historical detail in school, but back then nobody would have dreamed of such an escalation. It would have sounded too absurd. So why is the hindsight bias so perilous? Well, it makes us believe we're better predictors than we actually are, causing us to be arrogant about our knowledge and consequently to take too much risk and not just with global issues.
-  just so similar, or they spent too much time together, or even they barely saw one another. Overcoming the hindsight bias isn't easy. Studies have shown that people who are aware of it fall for it just as much as everyone else. So, I'm very sorry, but you've just wasted your time reading this chapter. If you're still with me, I have one final tip, this time from personal rather than professional experience. Type a journal. Write down your predictions. For political changes, your career, your weight, the stock market, and so on. Then, from time to time, compare your notes with actual developments. You'll be amazed.
-  developments. You'll be amazed at what a poor forecaster you are. Don't forget to read history too. Not the retrospective compacted theories compiled in textbooks, but the diaries, oral histories, and historical documents from the period. If you can't live without news, read newspapers from 5, 10, or 20 years ago. This will give you a much better sense of just how unpredictable the world is. Hindsight may provide temporary comfort to those overwhelmed by complexity, but as for providing deeper revelations about how the world works, you'll benefit by looking elsewhere.
-  the world works, you'll benefit by looking elsewhere. 15. Why you systematically overestimate your knowledge and abilities. Overconfidence Effect My favorite musician, Johann Sebastian Bach, was anything but a one-hit wonder. He composed numerous works. How many there were, I'll reveal at the end of this chapter. But for now, here's a small assignment. How many concertos do you think Bach composed? Choose a range, for example between 100 and 500, aiming for an estimate that is 98% correct and only 2% correct.
-  phenomenon, the overconfidence effect. The overconfidence effect also applies to forecasts such as stock market performance over a year or your firm's profits over three years. We systematically overestimate our knowledge and our ability to predict on a massive scale. The overconfidence effect does not deal with whether single estimates are correct or not, rather it measures the difference between what people really know and what they think they know. What surprising is this, experts suffer even more from the overconfidence effect than laypeople do. If asked to forecast oil prices in five years time,
-  by the optimistic figures, and through their activities, politicians get more votes. We'll examine this strategic misrepresentation, Chapter 89, later in the book. What makes the overconfidence effect so prevalent and its effects so confounding is that it's not driven by incentives. It's raw and innate. And it's not counterbalanced by the opposite effect, underconfidence, which doesn't exist. No surprise to some readers, the overconfidence effect is more pronounced in men. Women tend not to overestimate their knowledge and abilities as much. Even more troubling, optimists are not the only victims of the overconfidence effect.
-  confidence effect is more pronounced in men. Women tend not to overestimate their knowledge and abilities as much. Even more troubling, optimists are not the only victims of the overconfidence effect. Even self-proclaimed pessimists overrate themselves. Just less extremely. In conclusion, be aware that you tend to overestimate your knowledge. Be skeptical of predictions, especially if they come from so-called experts. And with all plans, favor the pessimistic scenario. This way you have a chance of judging the situation somewhat realistically. Back to the question from the beginning. Johann Sebastian
-  He may have composed considerably more, but they're lost. 16. Don't take news anchors seriously. Chauffeur Knowledge After receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918, Max Planck went on tour across Germany. Wherever he was invited, he delivered the same lecture on new quantum mechanics. Over time, his chauffeur grew to know it by heart. It has to be boring giving the same speech each time, Professor Planck. How about I do it for you in Munich? You can sit in the front row and wear my chauffeur's cap.
-  which is obviously not the case. To guard against the chauffeur effect, Warren Buffett, Munger's business partner, has coined a wonderful phrase, the circle of competence. What lies inside this circle you understand intuitively. What lies outside you may only partially comprehend. One of Munger's best pieces of advice is, you have to stick within what I call your circle of competence. You have to know what you understand and what you don't understand. It's not terribly important how big the circle is, but it is terribly important that you know where the perimeter is. Munger underscores this. So you have to fit in.
-  that you can make. You have to figure out where you've got an edge, and you've got to play within your own circle of competence. In conclusion, be on the lookout for chauffeur knowledge. Don't confuse the company spokesperson, the ringmaster, the newscaster, the schmoozer, the verbiage vendor, or the clichÃ© generator with those who possess true knowledge. How do you recognize the difference? There's a clear indicator. True experts recognize the limits of what they know and what they do not know. If they find themselves outside their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, I don't know.
-  even with a certain pride. From chauffeurs, we hear every line except this. 17. You control less than you think. Illusion of control. Every day, shortly before nine o'clock, a man with a red hat stands in a square and begins to wave his cap around wildly. After five minutes, he disappears. One day, a policeman comes up to him and asks, What are you doing? I'm keeping the giraffes away. But there aren't any giraffes here. Well, I must be doing a good job then. A friend with a broken
-  and as gingerly as possible if they're hoping for a low number, which is as nonsensical as football fans thinking they can swing a game by gesticulating in front of the TV. Unfortunately, they share this illusion with many people who also seek to influence the world by sending out the right thoughts, such as vibrations, positive energy, karma. The illusion of control is the tendency to believe that we can influence something over which we have absolutely no sway. This was discovered in 1965 by two researchers, Jenkins and Ward. Their experiment was simple, consisting of just two switches and a light.
-  positive energy, karma. The illusion of control is the tendency to believe that we can influence something over which we have absolutely no sway. This was discovered in 1965 by two researchers, Jenkins and Ward. Their experiment was simple, consisting of just two switches and a light. The men were able to adjust when the switches connected to the light and when not. Even when the light flashed on and off at random, subjects were still convinced that they could influence it by flicking the switches. Or consider this example. An American researcher has been investigating acoustic sensitivity to pain. For this,
-  the gym. The rock stars are everywhere. There are lots of them. And they are successful. Motivated by the stories of countless guitar heroes, Rick starts a band. Will he make it big? The probability lies a fraction above zero. Like so many others, he will most likely end up in the graveyard of failed musicians. This burial ground houses 10,000 times more musicians than the stage does. But no journalist is interested in failures, with the exception of fallen superstars. This makes the cemetery invisible to outsiders. In daily life,
-  encouraged these prisoners not to give up hope. Crossing the street in Los Angeles is a tricky business but luckily at the press of a button we can stop traffic or can we? The buttons real purpose is to make us believe we have an influence on the traffic lights and thus we're better able to endure the wait for the signal to change with more patience. The same goes for door open and door close buttons and elevators. Many are not even connected to the electrical panel. Such tricks are also designed in open plan offices. For some people it will always be too hot for others too cold. Clever technicians create
-  little of tangible value into the real economy. They're merely sound waves. And still we allow economic heads to continue to play with the illusory dials. It would be a real wake-up call if all involved realized the truth, that the world economy is a fundamentally uncontrollable system. And you? Do you have everything under control? Probably less than you think. Don't think you command your way through life like a Roman emperor. Rather, you're the man with the red hat. Therefore, focus on the few things of importance that you can really influence. For everything else, que sera sera.
-  To control a rat infestation, French colonial rulers in Hanoi in the 19th century passed a law. For every dead rat handed into the authorities, the catcher would receive a reward. Yes, many rats were destroyed, but many were also bred specially for this purpose. In 1947, when the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, archaeologists set a finder's fee for each new parchment. Instead of lots of extra scrolls being found, they were simply torn apart to increase the reward. Similarly, in China in the 19th century, an incentive was offered for finding diamonds.
-  Like so many others, he will most likely end up in the graveyard of failed musicians. This burial ground houses 10,000 times more musicians than the stage does, but no journalist is interested in failures, with the exception of fallen superstars. This makes the cemetery invisible to outsiders. In daily life, because triumph is made more visible than failure, you systematically overestimate your chances of succeeding. As an outsider, you, like Rick, succumb to an illusion, and you mistake how miniscule the probability of success really is.
-  all the benefits that came with it. It was win-win. Imagine for a moment that instead of demanding enemies' riches, warriors and soldiers charged by the hour, we'd effectively be incentivizing them to take as long as possible, right? So why do we do just this with lawyers, architects, consultants, accountants, and driving instructors? My advice? Forget hourly rates and always negotiate a fixed price in advance. Be wary, too, of investment advisors endorsing particular financial products. They're not interested in your financial well-being, but in earning a commission on these products. The same goes for entrepreneurs.
-  What makes up the remaining 10%? Passion, idiocy, psychosis, or malice. 19. The dubious efficacy of doctors, consultants, and psychotherapists. Regression to mean. His best friend.
-  their personal norms even without the training. The situation is similar with patients who are hospitalized for depression. They usually leave the clinic feeling a little better. It's quite possible, however, that the stay contributed absolutely nothing. Another example, in Boston, the lowest performing schools were entered into a complex support program. The following year, the schools had moved up in the rankings, an improvement that the authorities attributed to the program rather than to natural regression to mean. Ignoring regression to mean can have destructive consequences, such as teachers or managers concluding that the stick is bad.
-  stick is better than the carrot. For example, following a test, the highest performing students are praised and the lowest are castigated. In the next exam, other students will probably, purely coincidentally, achieve the highest and lowest scores. Thus, the teacher concludes that reproach helps and praise hinders, a fallacy that keeps on giving. In conclusion, when you hear stories such as, I was sick, went to the doctor, and got a few days later, or, the company had a bad year, so we got a consultant in, and now the results are back to normal. Look out for our old friend, the regression to mean error.
-  in and now the results are back to normal. Look out for our old friend, the regression to mean error. 20. Never judge a decision by its outcome. Outcome bias. A quick hypothesis. Say 1 million monkeys speculated
-  will have made a profit and the other half a loss. The ones that made a profit can stay, the ones that made a loss you send home. In the second week, one half of the monkeys will still be riding high, while the other half will have made a loss and are sent home. And so on. After ten weeks, about one thousand monkeys will be left, those who have always invested their money well. After twenty weeks, just one monkey will remain. This one always, without fail, chose the right stocks and is now a billionaire. Let's call him the success monkey. How does the media react? It will pounce on this animal to understand its success principles. And they will find some. Perhaps the monkey eats more bananas than others. Perhaps he sits in another corner of the cage. Or maybe he swings headlong through the branches. Or he takes long reflective pauses while he's eating.
-  Perhaps the monkey eats more bananas than others. Perhaps he sits in another corner of the cage. Or maybe he swings headlong through the branches. Or he takes long reflective pauses while grooming. He must have some recipe for success, right? How else could he perform so brilliantly? Spot on for two years, and that from a simple monkey? Impossible. The monkey story illustrates the outcome bias. We tend to evaluate decisions based on the result rather than on the decision process. This fallacy is also known as the historian error. A classic example is the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Should the military base have been evacuated or not?
-  known as the historian error. A classic example is the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Should the military base have been evacuated or not? From today's perspective, obviously, for there was plenty of evidence that an attack was imminent. However, only in retrospect do the signals appear so clear. At the time, in 1941, there was a plethora of contradictory signals. Some pointed to an attack, others did not. To assess the quality of the decision, we must use the information available at the time, filtering out everything we know about it post-attack, particularly that it did indeed take place. Another experiment.
-  There's a 33% chance that no one will die, a 41% chance that one person will die, and a 20% chance that two people will die. That's a simple probability calculation. What stands out, there is no huge difference between zero dead and two dead. To assess the three surgeons purely on the basis of the outcomes would be not only negligent, but also unethical. In conclusion, never judge a decision purely by its result, especially when randomness and external factors play a role. A bad result does not automatically indicate a bad decision, and vice versa. So rather than tearing your hair off,
-  The three surgeons purely on the basis of the outcomes would be not only negligent, but also unethical. In conclusion, never judge a decision purely by its result, especially when randomness and external factors play a role. A bad result does not automatically indicate a bad decision and vice versa. So rather than tearing your hair out about a wrong decision or applauding yourself for one that may have only coincidentally led to success, remember why you chose what you did. Were your reasons rational and understandable? Then you would do well to stick with that method even if you didn't strike it lucky last time.
-  then you would do well to stick with that method even if you didn't strike it lucky last time. 21. Less is More Paradox of Choice My sister and her husband bought an unfinished house a little while ago. Since then, we haven't been able to talk about anything else. The sole topic of conversation for the past two months has been bathroom tiles, ceramic, granite, marble, metal, stone, wood, glass, and every type of laminate known to man. Rarely have I seen my sister in such anguish.
-  but there is a limit. When it succeeded, a surfeit of choices destroys quality of life. The technical term for this is the paradox of choice. In his book of the same title, psychologist Barry Schwartz describes why this is so. First, a large selection needs to enter paralysis. To test this, a supermarket set up a stand where customers could sample 24 varieties of jelly. They could try as many as they liked and then buy them at a discount. The next day, the owners carried out the same experiment with only six flavors. The result? They sold ten times more jelly on day two. Why? Why?
-  To test this, a supermarket set up a stand where customers could sample 24 varieties of jelly. They could try as many as they liked and then buy them at a discount. The next day, the owners carried out the same experiment with only six flavors. The result? They sold ten times more jelly on day two. Why? With such a wide range, customers couldn't come to a decision, so they bought nothing. The experiment was repeated several times with different products. The results were always the same. Second, a broader selection leads to poorer decisions. If you ask young people what's important in a life partner, they reel off all the usual qualities.
-  selection process you already know, perhaps even from personal experience. Finally, large selection leads to discontent. How can you be sure you're making the right choice when 200 options surround and confound you? The answer is you cannot. The more choice you have, the more unsure and therefore dissatisfied you are afterward. So what can you do? Think carefully about what you want before you inspect existing offers. Write down these criteria and stick to them rigidly. Also realize that you can never make a perfect decision. Aiming for this is, given the flood of possibilities, a form of irrational precision.
-  you are afterward. So what can you do? Think carefully about what you want before you inspect existing offers. Write down these criteria and stick to them rigidly. Also realize that you can never make a perfect decision. Aiming for this is, given the flood of possibilities, a form of irrational perfectionism. Instead, learn to love a good choice. Yes, even in terms of life partners. Only the best will do. In this age of unlimited variety, rather the opposite is true. Good enough is the new optimum. Except of course for you and me.
-  Rather the opposite is true. Good enough is the new optimum. Except of course for you and me. 22. You like me. You really really like me. Liking bias.
-  the most successful car salesman in the world. His tip for success? There's nothing more effective in selling anything than getting the customer to believe, really believe, that you like him and care about him. Gerard doesn't just talk the talk. His secret weapon is sending a card to his customers each month. Just one sentence salutes them. I like you. The liking bias is startlingly simple to understand, and yet we continually fall prey to it. It means this, the more we like someone, the more inclined we are to buy from or help that person. Still, the question remains, what does likable even mean?
-  seem unfriendly and don't even make it into the background. C, A. In addition to engaging super attractive types, advertising also employs people like you and me. C, B. Those who are similar in appearance, accent, or background. In short, the more similar, the better. Mirroring is a standard technique in sales to get exactly this effect. Here the salesperson tries to copy the gestures, language, and facial expressions of his prospective client. If the buyer speaks very slowly and quietly, often scratching his head, it makes sense for the seller to speak slowly and quietly and to scratch his head now and then too. That makes him
-  the seller to speak slowly and quietly and to scratch his head now and then too. That makes him likeable in the eyes of the buyer, and thus a business deal is more likely. Finally, it's not unheard of for advertisers to pay us compliments. How many times have you bought something because you're worth it? Here factor C comes into play. We find people appealing if they like us. Compliments work wonders even if they ring hollow as a drum. So-called multi-level marketing, selling through personal networks, works solely because of the liking bias. Though there are excellent plastic containers in the supermarket for a quarter of the price, Tupperware generally is the best.
-  Bribery, I inquired. He shook his head. We were chatting and suddenly we got onto the topic of sailing. It turned out that both of us, the buyer and me, were die hard 470 dinghy fans. From that moment on, he liked me. I was a friend. So the deal was sealed. Amiability works better than bribery. So if you're a salesperson, make buyers think you like them, even if this means outright flattery. Even if you're a consumer, always judge a product independent of who is selling it. Banish the salespeople from your mind, or rather, pretend you don't like them.

Although it had a few miles on the odometer, it looked in perfect condition. I know a little about used cars, and to me it was worth around $40,000. However, the salesman was pushing for $50,000 and wouldn't budge a dime. When he called the next week to say he would accept $40,000 after all, I went for it.
-  I proceeded to offer me $53,000 in cash on the spot. I politely declined. Only on the way home did I realize how ridiculous I was to have said no. Something that I considered worth $40,000 had passed into my possession and suddenly taken on a value of more than $53,000. If I were thinking purely rationally, I would have sold the car immediately. But alas, I'd fallen under the influence of the endowment effect. We consider things to be more valuable the moment we own them. In other words, if we're selling something, we charge more for it than what we ourselves would be willing to spend. To probe this,
-  attached to their houses and thus systematically overestimate their value. They balk at the market price expecting buyers to pay more which is completely absurd since this excess is little more than sentimental value. Richard Thaler performed an interesting classroom experiment at Cornell University to measure the endowment effect. He distributed coffee mugs to half of the students and told them they could either take the mug home or sell it at a price they could specify. The other half of the students who didn't get a mug were asked how much they would be willing to pay for a mug. In other words Thaler set up a market for coffee mugs. One would expect that roughly fifty percent

The other half of the students who didn't get a mug were asked how much they would be willing to pay for a mug. In other words, Thaler set up a market for coffee mugs. One would expect that roughly 50% of the students would be willing to trade, to either sell or buy a mug. But the result was much lower than that. Why? The average owner would not sell below $5.25 and the average buyer would not pay more than $2.25 for a mug. We can safely say that we're better at collecting things than at casting them off.
-  buyer would not pay more than $2.25 for a mug. We can safely say that we're better at collecting things than at casting them off. Not only does this explain why we fill our homes with junk, but also why lovers of stamps, watches, and pieces of art part with them so seldomly. Amazingly, the endowment effect affects not only possession, but also near ownership. Auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's thrive on this. A person who bids until the end of an auction gets the feeling that the object is practically theirs, thus increasing its value. The would-be owner is suddenly willing to pay much more than planned.
-  I'll offer more insight on the winner's curse in chapter 35. There's a similar effect in the job market. If you're applying for a job and don't get a callback, you have every reason to be disappointed. However, if you make it to the final stages of the selection process and then receive the rejection, the disappointment can be much bigger, irrationally. Either you get the job or you don't. Nothing else should matter. In conclusion, don't cling to things. Enter your property something that the universe, whatever you believe this to be, has bestowed to you temporarily. Keep in mind that it can recoup this or more in the blink of an eye.
-  temporarily. Keep in mind that it can recoup this or more in the blink of an eye. 24. The Inevitability of Unlikely Events Coincidence At 7.15 p.m. on March 1, 1950, the 15 members of the church choir in Beatrice, Nebraska, were scheduled to meet for a rehearsal. For various reasons, they were all running late. The minister's family was delayed because his wife still had to iron their daughter's dress. One couple was held back when their car wouldn't start. The piano
-  One couple was held back when their car wouldn't start. The pianist wanted to be there 30 minutes early, but he fell into a deep sleep after dinner. And so on. At 7.25 p.m., the church exploded. The blast was heard all around the village. It blew out the walls and sent the roof crashing to the ground. Miraculously, nobody was killed. The fire chief traced the explosion back to a gas leak, even though members of the choir were convinced they had received a sign from God. Hand of God or coincidence? Something last week made me think of a good news.
-  Something last week made me think of my old school friend, Andy, whom I hadn't spoken to in a long time. Suddenly the phone rang. I picked it up and, lo and behold, it was Andy. I must be telepathic, I exclaimed excitedly. But telepathy or coincidence? On October 5, 1990, the San Francisco Examiner reported that Intel would take its rival, AMD, to court. Intel found out that the company was planning to launch a computer chip named AM386, a term that clearly referred to Intel's 386 chip. How Intel came upon the information is remarkable.
-  rehearsals and their churches don't blow up. Suddenly the story has lost its unimaginable quality. For all these millions of churches, it would be improbable if something like what happened in Beatrice, Nebraska didn't take place at least once a century. So no hand of God. And anyway, why would God want to blow a church to smithereens? Let's apply the same thinking to the phone call. Keep in mind the many occasions when Andy thinks of you but doesn't call. When you think of him and he doesn't call. When you don't think of him and he calls. When he doesn't think of you and you call.
-  It's not surprising when they finally happen. What would be more surprising is if they never came to be 25 the calamity of conformity group think Have you ever bitten your tongue in a meeting surely you sit there say nothing and not along to proposals After all you don't want to be the eternal naysayer Moreover you might not be 100% sure why you disagree Whereas the others are unanimous and far from stupid so you keep your mouth shut for another day When everyone thinks and acts like this
-  percent sure why you disagree, whereas the others are unanimous and far from stupid. So you keep your mouth shut for another day. When everyone thinks and acts like this, groupthink is at work. This is where a group of smart people makes reckless decisions because everyone aligns their opinions with the supposed consensus. Thus, motions are passed that each individual group member would have rejected if no peer pressure had been involved. Groupthink is a special branch of social proof, a flaw that we discussed in Chapter 4. In March 1960, the U.S. Secret Service began to mobilize anti-communist
-  no peer pressure had been involved. Groupthink is a special branch of social proof, a flaw that we discussed in Chapter 4. In March 1960, the U.S. Secret Service began to mobilize anti-communist exiles from Cuba, most of them living in Miami, to use against Fidel Castro's regime. In January 1961, two days after taking office, President Kennedy was informed about the secret plan to invade Cuba. Three months later, a key meeting took place at the White House where Kennedy and his advisors all voted in favor of the invasion. On April 17, 1961, a brigade of about 1,400

In January 1961, two days after taking office, President Kennedy was informed about the secret plan to invade Cuba. Three months later, a key meeting took place at the White House where Kennedy and his advisors all voted in favor of the invasion. On April 17, 1961, a brigade of about 1,400 exiled Cubans landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south coast with the help of the U.S. Navy, the Air Force, and the CIA. The aim was to overthrow Castro's government. However, nothing went as planned.
-  1,800 exiled Cubans landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south coast with the help of the US Navy the Air Force and the CIA the aim was to overthrow Castro's government However, nothing went as planned on the first day Not a single supply ship reached the coast The Cuban Air Force sank the first two and the next two turned around and fled back to the United States a day later Castro's army completely surrounded the brigade on the third day the 1,200 survivors were taken into custody and sent to military prisons Kennedy's invasion of the Bay of Pigs is regarded as one of the biggest flops in American foreign policy
-  The 1200 survivors were taken into custody and sent to military prisons. Kennedy's invasion of the Bay of pigs is regarded as one of the biggest flops in American foreign policy that such an absurd plan was ever agreed upon. Nevermind put into action is astounding. All of the assumptions that spoke in favor of the invasion were erroneous. For example, Kennedy's team completely underestimated the strength of Cuba's air force. Also, it was expected that in an emergency, the brigade would be able to hide in the Escambray Mountains and carry out an underground war against Castro from there. A glance at the map shows that the refuge was 100 miles
-  as Air Force. Also, it was expected that in an emergency the brigade would be able to hide in the Escambray Mountains and carry out an underground war against Castro from there. A glance at the map shows that the refuge was 100 miles away from the Bay of Pigs, with an insurmountable swamp in between. And yet, Kennedy and his advisors were among the most intelligent people to ever run an American government. What went wrong between January and April 1961? Psychology professor Irving Janis has studied many fiascos. He concluded that they share the following pattern. Members of a close-knit group
-  Psychology professor Irving Janus has studied many fiascos. He concluded that they share the following pattern. Members of a close-knit group cultivate team spirit by unconsciously building illusions. One of these fantasies is a belief in invincibility. If both our leader, in this case Kennedy, and the group are confident that the plan will work, then luck will be on our side. Next comes the illusion of unanimity. If the others are of the same opinion, any dissenting view must be wrong. No one wants to be the naysayer that destroys team unity. Finally, each person is happy to be part of the team.

Hence our strong urge to remain in the group's favor. Groupthink is no secret.
-  in the business world. A classic example is the fate of the world-class airline, Swissair. Here, a group of highly paid consultants rallied around the former CEO and, bolstered by the euphoria of past successes, they developed a high-risk expansion strategy, including the acquisition of several European airlines. The zealous team built up such a strong consensus that even rational reservations were suppressed, leading to the airline's collapse in 2001. If you ever find yourself in a tight, unanimous group, you must speak your mind, even if your team doesn't like it. Question tacit assumptions even

Two games of chance. In the first, you can win $10 million, and in the second, $10,000. Which do you play? If you win the first game, it changes your life completely. You can quit your job, tell your boss where to go, and live off the winnings. If you hit the jackpot in the second game, you can take a nice vacation in the Caribbean, but you'll be back at your house.
-  jackpots, mega millions, mega billions, mega trillions, no matter how small the odds are. In a classic experiment from 1972, participants were divided into two groups. The members of the first group were told that they would receive a small electric shock. In the second group, subjects were told that the risk of this happening was only 50%. The researchers measured physical anxiety, heart rate, nervousness, sweating, etc., shortly before commencing. The results were, well, shocking. There was absolutely no difference. Participants in both groups were equally stressed.

The researchers measured physical anxiety, heart rate, nervousness, sweating, etc., shortly before commencing. The results were, well, shocking. There was absolutely no difference. Participants in both groups were equally stressed. Next, the researchers announced a series of reductions in the probability of a shock for the second group, from 50% to 20%, then 10%, then 5%. The result? Still no difference. However, when they declared that they would increase the probability of a shock, they were told that the risk of this happening was only 50%. The researchers announced a series of reductions in the probability of a shock for the second group, from 50% to 20%, then 10%, then 5%. The results? Still no difference. However, when they declared that they would increase the probability of a shock for the third group, from 50% to 20%, then 10%, then 5%, the result? Still no difference.

Next, the researchers announced a series of reductions in the probability of a shock for the second group, from 50% to 20%, then 10%, then 5%. The result? Still no difference. However, when they declared that they would increase the strength of the expected current, both groups' anxiety levels rose. Again, by the same degree. This illustrates that we respond to the expected magnitude of an event, the size of the jackpot, or the amount of electricity.
-  group, from 50% to 20%, then 10%, then 5%. The result? Still no difference. However, when they declared that they would increase the strength of the expected current, both groups' anxiety levels rose, again by the same degree. This illustrates that we respond to the expected magnitude of an event, the size of the jackpot or the amount of electricity, but not to its likelihood. In other words, we lack an intuitive grasp of probability. The proper term for this is neglect of probability, and it leads to errors in decision making. We invest in startups because of their lack of probability.
-  Google shares with a return of 20% must be twice as good as property that returns 10%. That's wrong. It would be a lot smarter to also consider both investments risks. But then again, we have no natural feel for this, so we often turn a blind eye to it. Back to the experiment with the electric shocks. In Group B, the probability of getting a jolt was further reduced from 5% to 4% to 3%, only when the probability reached zero did Group B respond differently than Group A. To us, 0% risk seems infinitely better than a highly improbable 1% risk.
-  1% risk. To test this, let's examine two methods of treating drinking water. Suppose a river has two equally large tributaries. One is treated using method A, which reduces the risk of dying from contaminated water from 5% to 2%. The other is treated using method B, which reduces the risk from 1% to 0%. That is, the threat is completely eliminated. So method A or B? If you think like most people, you'll opt for method B, which is silly because with measure A, 3% fewer people die, and with B, just 1% fewer. Method A is three times as good.
-  one percent fewer. Method A is three times as good. This fallacy is called the zero risk bias. A classic example of this is the US Food Act of 1958, which prohibits food that contains cancer causing substances. Instituted to achieve zero risk of cancer, this ban sounds good at first, but it ended up leading to the use of more dangerous but non-carcinogenic food additives. It's also absurd. As Paracelsus illustrated in the 16th century, poisoning is always a question of dosage. Furthermore, this law can never be enforced properly since it's impossible to remove the last
-  good at first, but it ended up leading to the use of more dangerous but non-carcinogenic food additives. It's also absurd. As Paracelsus illustrated in the 16th century, poisoning is always a question of dosage. Furthermore, this law can never be enforced properly since it's impossible to remove the last banned molecule from food. Each farm would have to function like a hyper sterile computer chip factory and the cost of food would increase a hundredfold. Economically, zero risk rarely makes sense. One exception is when the consequences are colossal, such as a deadly highly contagious virus escaping from a biotech laboratory.
-  a hundredfold. Economically, zero risk rarely makes sense. One exception is when the consequences are colossal, such as a deadly, highly contagious virus escaping from a biotech laboratory. We have no intuitive grasp of risk, and thus distinguish poorly among different threats. The more serious the threat, and the more emotional the topic, such as radioactivity, the less reassuring a reduction in risk seems to us. Two researchers at the University of Chicago have shown that people are equally afraid of a 99% chance, as they are of a 1% chance of contamination by toxic chemicals.
-  a 1% chance of contamination by toxic chemicals. An irrational response, but a common one. 27, why the last cookie in the jar makes your mouth water? Scarcity error. Coffee at a friend's house. We sat trying to make conversation while her three children grappled with one another on the floor. Suddenly I remembered that I had brought some glass marbles with me, a whole bag full. I spilled them out on the floor in the hope that the little angels would play with them in peace. Far from it. A heated argument ensued. I didn't understand what was happening.

-  email service, I was dead set on getting an account. In the end, I did. At the time, new accounts were very restricted and were given out only by invitation. This made me want one even more. But why? Certainly not because I needed another email account. Back then, I already had four. Nor because Gmail was better than the competition. But simply because not everyone had access to it. Looking back, I have to laugh at how childish adults are. Rara sunt cara, said the Romans. Rare is valuable. In fact, the scarcity error is as old as mankind. My friend with the three children is a part-time realtor.
-  as old as mankind. My friend with the three children is a part-time real estate agent. Whenever she has an interested buyer who cannot decide, she calls and says, ï¿½A doctor from London saw the plot of land yesterday. He liked it a lot. What about you? Are you still interested?ï¿½ The doctor from London, sometimes itï¿½s a professor or a banker, is of course fictitious. The effect is very real, though. It causes prospects to see the opportunity disappearing before their eyes, so they act and close the deal. Why? This is the potential shortage of supply, yet again. Objectively, is incomprehensible. Either the prospect wants the

The first group received an entire box of cookies and the second group just two. In the end, the subjects with just two cookies rated the quality much higher than the first group did. The experiment was repeated several times and always showed the same result. Meanwhile stocks last, the ads alert. Today only, warn the posters. Gallery owners take advantage of the scarcity error by placing red sold dots under most of their paintings, transforming the remaining few works into rare items.
-  no practical purpose. The post office doesn't accept the old stamps, the banks don't take old coins, and the vintage cars are no longer allowed on the road. These are all side issues. The attraction is that they're in short supply. In one study, students were asked to arrange ten posters in order of attractiveness, with the agreement that afterward they could keep one poster as a reward for their participation. Five minutes later, they were told that the poster with the third highest rating was no longer available. Then they were asked to judge all ten from scratch. The poster that was no longer available was suddenly classified as the most beautiful.

When we're deprived of an option, we suddenly deem it more attractive. It's a kind of act of defiance. It's also known as the Romeo and Juliet effect.
-  Romeo and Juliet effect. Because the love between the tragic Shakespearean teenagers is forbidden, it knows no bounds. This yearning must not necessarily be in a romantic way. In the United States, student parties are often littered with desperately drunk teenagers. In Europe, where the age limit is 18, you don't witness this type of behavior. In conclusion, the typical response to scarcity is a lapse in clear thinking. They purchase products and services solely on the basis of their price and benefits. It should be of no importance if an item is disappearing fast or if any doctors from London take an interest.
-  It should be of no importance if an item is disappearing fast or if any doctors from London take an interest. 28. When you hear hoofbeats, don't expect a zebra. Base rate neglect. Mark is a thin man from Germany with glasses who likes to listen to Mozart. Which is more likely, that A. Mark is a truck driver or B. He is a professor of literature in Frankfurt. Most will bet on B, which is wrong. Germany has 10,000 times more truck drivers than Frankfurt has literature professors.
-  B, he is a professor of literature in Frankfurt. Most will bet on B, which is wrong. Germany has 10,000 times more truck drivers than Frankfurt has literature professors. Therefore, it's more likely that Mark is a truck driver. So what just happened? The detailed description enticed us to overlook the statistical reality. Scientists call this fallacy base rate neglect, a disregard of fundamental distribution levels. It's one of the most common errors in reasoning. Virtually all journalists, economists, and politicians fall for it on a regular basis. Here's a second example.
-  Now, option B is much more likely because there are a million times more middle class Americans than there are Russian knife importers. In medicine, base rate neglect plays an important role. For example, migraines can point, among others, to a viral infection or a brain tumor. However, viral infections are much more common. In other words, they have a higher base rate. So doctors assess patients for these first before testing for tumors. This is very reasonable. In medical school, residents spend a lot of time purging base rate neglect. The motto drummed into any prospective doctor in the United States is, When you hear hoofbeats behind you,

In the summer of 1913 something incredible happened in Monte Carlo. Crowds gathered around a roulette table and could not believe their eyes. The ball had landed on black 20 times in a row. Many players took advantage of the opportunity and immediately put their money on red. But the ball continued to come to rest on black. Even more people flocked to the table to bet on red. It had to change eventually but it was black yet again and again and again. It was not until the 27th spin that the ball eventually landed on red.
-  A ball cannot remember how many times it has landed on black. Despite this, one of my friends entered the weekly Mega Millions numbers into a spreadsheet and then plays those that have appeared the least. All this work is for naught. He is another victim of the gambler's fallacy. The following joke illustrates this phenomenon. A mathematician is afraid of flying due to the small risk of a terrorist attack, so on every flight he takes a bomb with him in his hand luggage. The probability of having a bomb on the plane is very low, he reasons, and the probability of having two bombs on the same plane is virtually zero. A coin is flipped three times and lands on black.
-  mean. An example, if you're experiencing record cold where you live, it's likely that the temperature will return to normal values over the next few days. If the weather functioned like a casino, there would be a 50% chance that the temperature would rise and a 50% chance that it would drop. But the weather isn't like a casino. Complex feedback mechanisms in the atmosphere ensure that extremes balance themselves out. In other cases, however, extremes intensify. For example, the rich tend to get richer. A stock that shoots up creates its own demand to a certain extent simply because it stands out so much. A sort of reverse compensation effect.

If you don't know the year off the top of your head and your smartphone battery has just died, how do you answer this? Perhaps you know that he was president during the Civil War in the 1860s and that he was a member of the United States in the 1860s and that he was the first U.S. president to be assassinated. Looking at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, you don't see a young, energetic man, but something more akin to a worn-out, sick, and tired man.
-  Let's assume that he was assassinated in the mid-1860s, making 1805 our estimate for the year he was born. The correct answer is 1809. So how did we work it out? We found an anchor to help us, the year 1865, and worked from there to an educated guess. Whenever we have to guess something, the length of the Mississippi River, population density in Russia, the number of nuclear power plants in France, we use anchors. We start with something we're sure of and venture into unfamiliar territory from there. How else could we do it? Just pick a number off the top of our heads? That would be irrational.
-  As with the swimmers' bodies, beauty is a factor for selection and not the result. Whenever we confuse selection factors with results, we fall prey to what Taleb calls the swimmers' body illusion. Without this illusion, half of advertising campaigns would not work. But this bias has to do with more than just the pursuit of chiseled cheekbones and chests. For example, Harvard has the reputation of being a top university. Many highly successful people have studied there. Does this mean that Harvard is a good school? We don't know. Perhaps the school is terrible and it simply recruits the best of the best.
-  We start with something we're sure of and venture into unfamiliar territory from there. How else could we do it? Just pick a number off the top of our heads? That would be irrational. Unfortunately, we also use anchors when we don't need to. For example, one day in a lecture, a professor placed a bottle of wine on the table. He asked his students to write down the last two digits of their social security numbers and then decide if they would be willing to spend that amount on the wine. In the auction that followed, students with higher numbers bid nearly twice as much as students with lower numbers. The social security digits worked as an anchor, albeit in a hidden and misleading way.

The highest estimates came from people who had spun high numbers on the wheel. Researchers Russo and Shoemaker also asked students in what year Attila the Hun suffered his crushing defeat in Europe. Just like the example with Social Security numbers, the numbers were anchored, this time with the last few digits of their telephone number. The result? People with higher numbers chose later years, and vice versa. If you were wondering, Attila's demise came about in 453.
-  they were informed about a randomly generated listed sales price. As might be expected, the anchor influenced the students. The higher this price, the higher they valued the property. And the professionals, did they value the house objectively? No, they were similarly influenced by the random anchor amount. The more uncertain the value of something, such as real estate, company stock, or art, the more susceptible even experts are to anchors. Anchors abound, and we all clutch to them. The recommended retail price printed on many products is nothing more than an anchor. Sales professionals know they must
-  random anchor amount. The more uncertain the value of something, such as real estate, company stock, or art, the more susceptible even experts are to anchors. Anchors abound, and we all clutch to them. The recommended retail price printed on many products is nothing more than an anchor. Sales professionals know they must establish a price at an early stage, long before they have an offer. Also, it's been proven that if teachers know students' past grades, it influences how they'll mark new work. The most recent grades act as a starting point. In my early years, I had a quick stint at a consulting firm. My boss was a pro when it came to marketing.
-  past grades, it influences how they'll mark new work. The most recent grades act as a starting point. In my early years, I had a quick stint at a consulting firm. My boss was a pro when it came to using anchors. In his first conversation with any client, he made sure to fix an opening price, which, by the way, almost criminally exceeded our internal costs. I'll tell you this now so you're not surprised when you receive the quote, Mr. So-and-so. You've just completed a similar project for one of your competitors, and it was in the range of $5 million. The anchor was dropped. The price negotiation started at exactly $5 million.

At first the shy animal is hesitant, wondering, what's going on here? Why is he feeding me? This continues for a few more weeks until eventually the goose's skepticism gives way. After a few months, the goose is sure. The farmer has my best interests at heart. Each additional day's feeding confirmed.
-  After a few months, the goose is sure. The farmer has my best interests at heart. Each additional day's feeding confirms this. Fully convinced of the man's benevolence, the goose is amazed when he takes it out of its enclosure on Christmas Day and slaughters it. The Christmas goose fell victim to inductive thinking, the inclination to draw universal certainties from individual observations. Philosopher David Hume used this allegory back in the 18th century to warn of its pitfalls. However, it's not just geese that are susceptible to it. An investor buys shares in StockX.
-  Hume used this allegory back in the 18th century to warn of its pitfalls. However, it's not just geese that are susceptible to it. An investor buys shares in stock X. The share price rockets, and at first he's wary. Probably a bubble, he suspects. As the stock continues to rise, even after months, his apprehension turns into excitement. This stock may never come down, especially since every day this is the case. After half a year, he invests his life savings in it, turning a blind eye to the huge cluster risk this poses. Later, the man will pay for his foolish investment.
-  Harvard has the reputation of being a top university. Many highly successful people have studied there. Does this mean that Harvard is a good school? We don't know. Perhaps the school is terrible, and it simply recruits the brightest students around. I experienced this phenomenon at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. It's said to be one of the top ten business schools in Europe, but the lessons I received, albeit 25 years ago, were mediocre. Nevertheless, many of its graduates were successful. The reason behind this is unknown. Perhaps it was due to the climate in the narrow valley, or even the cafeteria food. Most probably, it was because of the high-quality food.
-  investment, he's fallen hook, line, and sinker for induction. Inductive thinking doesn't have to be a road to ruin, though. In fact, you can make a fortune with it by sending a few emails. Here's how. Put together two stock market forecasts, one predicting that prices will rise next month and one warning of a drop. Send the first mail to 50,000 people and the second mail to a different set of 50,000. Suppose that after one month, the indices have fallen. Now you can send another email, but this time only to the 50,000 people who received a correct prediction. These 50,000 you divide into two groups. The first half results in a drop.
-  and one warning of a drop. Send the first mail to 50,000 people, and the second mail to a different set of 50,000. Suppose that after one month, the indices have fallen. Now you can send another email, but this time only to the 50,000 people who received a correct prediction. These 50,000 you divide into two groups. The first half learns the prices will increase next month, and the second half discovers they will fall. Continue doing this. After 10 months, around 100 people will remain, all of whom you've advised impeccably. From their perspective, you're a genius. You've proven that you're truly in possession of prophetic powers.

Some of these people will trust you with their money. Take it and start a new life in Brazil. However, it's not just naive strangers who get deceived in this way. We constantly trick ourselves too. For example, people who are rarely ill consider them
-  survival is a serious flaw in reasoning. Probably the most serious of all. 32. Why evil is more striking than good. Loss aversion. On a scale of 1 to 10, how good do you feel today? Now consider what would bring you up to a perfect 10. That vacation in the Caribbean you've always dreamed of? A step up the career ladder, maybe. Next question. What would make you drop down by the same number of points? Paralysis, Alzheimer's, cancer, depression, war, hunger, torture, financial ruin, damage to health,
-  In our evolutionary past, this was even more the case. One stupid mistake and you were dead. Everything could lead to your rapid departure from the game of life. Carelessness on the hunt, an inflamed tendon, exclusion from the group, and so on. People who were reckless or gung-ho died before they could pass their genes on to the next generation. Those who remained, the cautious, survived. We are their descendants. So no wonder we fear loss more than we value gain. Losing $100 costs you a greater amount of happiness than the delight you would feel if I gave you $100. In fact, it's been proven that emotionally a loss weighs about twice that of a similar gain. Social scientists call this loss aversion. For this reason, it's not a good idea to be a victim of loss.

Losing $100 costs you a greater amount of happiness than the delight you would feel if I gave you $100. In fact, it's been proven that emotionally a loss weighs about twice that of a similar gain. Social scientists call this loss aversion. For this reason, if you want to convince someone about something, don't focus on the advantages. Instead, highlight how it helps them dodge the disadvantages. Here's an example from a campaign promoting breast self-examination, BSE. Two differently
-  Here's an example from a campaign promoting breast self-examination, BSE. Two different leaflets were handed out to women. Pamphlet A urged, research shows that women who do BSE have an increased chance of finding a tumor in the early more treatable state of the disease. Pamphlet B said, research shows that women who do not BSE have a decreased chance of finding a tumor in the early more treatable state of the disease. The study revealed that pamphlet B, written in a loss frame, generated significantly more awareness and BSE behavior than pamphlet A, written in a gain frame. The fear of losing a tumor is a key factor in the BSE.
-  of the disease. The study revealed that pamphlet B, written in a loss frame, generated significantly more awareness and BSE behavior than pamphlet A, written in a gain frame. The fear of losing something motivates people more than the prospect of gaining something of equal value. Suppose your business is home insulation. The most effective way of encouraging customers to purchase your product is to tell them how much money they're losing without insulation, as opposed to how much money they would save with it, even though the amount is exactly the same. This type of aversion is also found on the stock market, where investors tend to simply ignore losses on paper.
-  $100 bill. What a waste of emotion. I pointed out that the value of his portfolio fluctuated by at least $100 every second. Management gurus push employees in large companies to be bolder and more entrepreneurial. The reality is, employees tend to be risk averse. From their perspective, this aversion makes perfect sense. Why risk something that brings them, at best, a nice bonus and, at worst, a pink slip? The downside is larger than the upside. In almost all companies and situations, safeguarding your career trumps any potential reward. So if you've been scratching your head about the lack of risk-takers,
-  in situations safeguarding your career trumps any potential reward. So if you've been scratching your head about the lack of risk taking among your employees, you now know why. However, if employees do take big risks, it is often when they can hide behind group decisions. Learn more in Chapter 33 on social loafing. We can't fight it. Evil is more powerful and more plentiful than good. We are more sensitive to negative than to positive things. On the street, scary faces stand out more than smiling ones. We remember bad behavior longer than good. Except, of course, when it comes to ourselves.
-  the horrendously high tuition fees pay for themselves over a short period of time. Many prospective students fall for this approach. I'm not implying that the schools doctor the statistics, but still their statements must not be swallowed wholesale. Why? Because those who pursue an MBA are different from those who do not. The income gap between both groups stems from a multitude of reasons that have nothing to do with the MBA degree itself. Once again, we see the swimmer's body illusion at work, the factor for selection confused with the result. So if you're considering further study, do it for reasons other than the MBA degree.
-  Nuremberg trials, or less controversially, any board or management team. We hide behind team decisions. The technical term for this is diffusion of responsibility. For the same reason, teams tend to take bigger risks than their members would take on their own. The individual group members reason that they're not the only ones who will be blamed if things go wrong. This effect is called risky shift and is especially hazardous among companies and pension fund strategists, where billions are at stake, or in the defense department, where groups decide on the use of nuclear weapons. In conclusion, people behave differently in groups than when alone. Otherwise, there would be no groups. The disadvantages of groups can be mitigated by making individual performances as visible as possible. Long live meritocracy. Long live the performance society.

How thick will it be after 50 folds? Write down your guess before you continue reading. Second task. Choose between these options. A. Over the next 30 days, I will give you $1,000 a day. B. I will give you $1,000 a day.
-  Choose between these options. A. Over the next 30 days, I will give you $1,000 a day. B. Over the next 30 days, I will give you a cent on the first day, two cents on the second day, four cents on the third day, eight cents on the fourth day, and so on. Don't think too long about it. A or B. Are you ready? Well, if we assume that a sheet of copy paper is approximately 0.004 inches thick, then its thickness after 50 folds is a little over 60 million miles. This equals the distance between the Earth and the Sun, as you can check easily with a calculator. With the second...
-  over 60 million miles. This equals the distance between the Earth and the Sun, as you can check easily with a calculator. With the second question, it's worthwhile choosing option B even though A sounds more tempting. Selecting A earns you $30,000 in 30 days. Choosing B gives you more than $5 million. Linear growth we understand intuitively. However, we have no sense of exponential or percentage growth. Why is this? Because we didn't need it before. Our ancestors' experiences were mostly of the linear variety. Whoever spent twice the time collecting berries earned double the money.
-  and 30 days. Choosing B gives you more than five million dollars. Linear growth we understand intuitively. However, we have no sense of exponential or percentage growth. Why is this? Because we didn't need it before. Our ancestors' experiences were mostly of the linear variety. Whoever spent twice the time collecting berries earned double the amount. Whoever hunted two mammoths instead of one could eat for twice as long. In the Stone Age, people rarely came across exponential growth. Today, things are different. Each year the number of traffic accidents rises by 7 percent, warns a politician.
-  came across exponential growth. Today, things are different. Each year the number of traffic accidents rises by 7% warns a politician. Let's be honest, we don't intuitively understand what this means. So let's use a trick and calculate the doubling time. Start with the magic number of 70 and divide it by the growth rate in percent. In this instance, 70 divided by 7 equals 10 years. So what the politician is saying, the number of traffic accidents doubles every 10 years. Pretty alarming. You may ask why the number 70. This has to do with a mathematical concept called logarithm.
-  years. So what the politician is saying, the number of traffic accidents doubles every 10 years. Pretty alarming. You may ask why the number 70. This has to do with a mathematical concept called logarithm. You can look it up in the notes section. Another example, inflation is at 5%. Whoever hears this thinks, that's not so bad. What's 5% anyway? Let's quickly calculate the doubling time. 70 divided by 5 equals 14 years. In 14 years, a dollar will be worth only half what it is today. A catastrophe for anyone who has a savings account. Suppose you're a journalist and learned that the number of registered

Let's quickly calculate the doubling time 70 divided by 5 equals 14 years in 14 years a dollar will be worth only half what it is today a catastrophe for anyone who has a savings account Suppose you're a journalist and learned that the number of registered dogs in your city is rising by 10% a year Which headline do you put on your article? Certainly not dog registrations increasing by 10% No one will care instead announce deluge of dogs twice as many mutts in seven years time Nothing that grows exponentially grows forever most politicians
-  than for you to cover the chessboard with rice, putting one grain of rice on the first square, and then on every subsequent square, twice the previous number of grains." The king was astonished. "'It's an honor to you, dear courtier, that you present such a modest request.' "'But how much rice is that?' The king guessed about a sack. Only when his servants began the task, placing a grain on the first square, two grains of rice on the second square, four grains of rice on the third, and so on, did he realize that he would need more rice than was growing on earth. When it comes to growth rates, the king was not surprised.

-  others are not privy to. This was not the case in Texas. The oil managers actually celebrated a Pyrrhic victory. Today, this phenomenon affects us all. From eBay to Groupon to Google AdWords, prices are consistently set by auction. Bidding wars for cell phone frequencies drive telecom companies to the brink of bankruptcy. Airports rent out their commercial spaces to the highest bidder. And if Walmart plans to introduce a new detergent and asks for tenders from five suppliers, that's nothing more than an auction, with the risk of the winner's curse. The auctioning of everyday life has now reached tradesmen, too.
-  despair the poor painter, the winner's curse. Initial public offerings, IPOs, are also examples of auctions. And when companies buy other companies, the infamous mergers and acquisitions, the winner's curse is present more often than not. Astoundingly, more than half of all acquisitions destroy value, according to a McKinsey study. So why do we fall victim to the winner's curse? First, the real value of many things is uncertain. Additionally, the more interested parties, the greater the likelihood of an overly enthusiastic bid. Second, we want to outdo competitors. A friend owns a micro antenna factory and told me
-  have to cough up $99. So you continue to bid. At $110, you have a guaranteed loss of $10, but your opponent would have to shell out $109, his last bid. So he'll continue playing. When do you stop? When will your competitor give up? Try it out with friends. In conclusion, accept this piece of wisdom about auctions from Warren Buffett. Don't go. If you happen to work in an industry where they're inevitable, set a maximum price and deduct 20% from this to offset the winner's curse. Write this number on a piece of paper and don't go ascent over it.
-  from this to offset the winner's curse. Write this number on a piece of paper and don't go ascent over it. 36, never ask a writer if the novel is autobiographical. Fundamental attribution error. Opening the newspaper, you learn that another CEO has been forced to step down because of bad results. In the sports section, you read that your team's winning season was thanks to player X or coach Y. In history books, you learn that the success of the French army in the early 1800s is a testament to Napoleon's superb leadership and strategy. Every story has a fate.
-  In history books, you learn that the success of the French army in the early 1800s is a testament to Napoleon's superb leadership and strategy. Every story has a face, it seems. Indeed, this is an ironclad rule in every newsroom. Always on the lookout for the people angle, journalists and their readers take this principle one step further and thus fall prey to the fundamental attribution error. This describes the tendency to overestimate individuals' influence and underestimate external situational factors. In 1967, researchers at Duke University set up the following experiment. Participants read an argument.
-  called out, not of course, vice versa. We may smirk at these stories, but false causality leads us astray practically every day. Consider the headline, employee motivation leads to higher corporate profits. Does it? Maybe people are simply more motivated because the company's doing well. Another headline touts that the more women on a corporate board, the more profitable the firm is. But is that really how it works? Or do highly profitable firms simply tend to recruit more women to their boards? Business book authors and consultants often operate with similar false, or at least fuzzy, causalities.
-  tend to use shampoo XYZ. And perhaps that's because it says, especially for thick hair on the bottle. Recently I read that students get better grades at school if their homes contain a lot of books. This study was surely a shot in the arm for booksellers, but it's another fine example of false causality. The simple truth is that educated parents tend to value their children's education more than uneducated ones do. Plus educated parents often have more books at home. In short, a dust-covered copy of War and Peace alone isn't going to influence anyone's grades. What counts is parents' education levels as well as their genes.
-  Before you decide to take the plunge, look in the mirror and be honest about what you see. 3. Why you see shapes in the clouds. Clustering illusion. In 1957, Swedish opera singer Fredrik Jorgensen bought a tape player to record his vocals. When he listened back to the recording, he heard strange noises throughout, whispers that sounded like supernatural messages. A few years later, he recorded Birdsong. This time he heard the voice of his deceased mother.
-  example of false causality was the supposed relationship between the birth rate and the number of stork pairs in Germany. Both were in decline and if you plot them on a graph the two lines of development from 1965 to 1987 appear almost identical. Does this mean the stork actually does bring babies? Obviously not since this was a purely coincidental correlation. In conclusion correlation is not causality. Take a closer look at linked events. Sometimes what's presented as the cause turns out to be the effect and vice versa and sometimes there is no link at all just like with the stork and babies.
-  quality such as beauty, social status, age produces a positive or negative impression that outshines everything else and that the overall effect is disproportionate. Beauty is the best studied example. Dozens of studies have shown that we automatically regard good-looking people as more pleasant, honest, and intelligent. Attractive people also have it easier in their professional lives and that has nothing to do with the myth of women sleeping their way to the top. The effect can even be detected in schools where teachers unconsciously give good-looking students better grades. Advertising has found an ally in the halo effect. Just look at the number of celebrities smiling

What makes a professional tennis player like Roger Federer a coffee machine expert is still open for debate, but this hasn't detracted from the success of the campaign. We're so used to seeing celebrities promoting arbitrary products that we never stop to consider why their support should be of any importance to us. But this is exactly the sneaky part of the halo effect. It works on a subconscious level. All that needs to register is the attractive face, dream lifestyle and that product.
-  in the area, complete with photos of the magnificent buildings and the beautiful second wives that you and your neighbor have accrued. He comments on the interior design and the exquisite landscaping. However, the crucial difference between the two of you remains hidden from view, the risk that lurks behind each of the $10 million. For this, he would need to recognize the alternative path. But not only journalists are underachievers at this skill, we all are. Alternative paths are all the outcomes that could have happened but didn't. With the game of Russian roulette, four alternative paths would have led to the same result, winning the $10 million.
-  Recently I was at a dinner with an American friend who suggested tossing a coin to decide who should pay the bill. He lost. The situation was uncomfortable for me since he was my guest in Switzerland. Next time I'll pay, whether here or in New York, I promised. He thought for a moment and said, considering the alternative paths, you've actually already paid for half of this dinner. In conclusion, risk is not directly visible. Always consider what the alternative paths are. Success that comes about through risky dealings is, to a rational mind, of less worth than success achieved the boring way. For example, with laborious work.
-  directly visible. Therefore, always consider what the alternative paths are. Success that comes about through risky dealings is to a rational mind of less worth than success achieved the boring way. For example, with laborious work as a lawyer, a dentist, a ski instructor, a pilot, a hairdresser, or a consultant. Yes, looking at alternative paths from the outside is a difficult task. Looking at them from the inside an almost impossible task. Your brain will do everything to convince you that your success is warranted, no matter how risky your dealings are, and will obscure any thought of paths other than the one you're on.
-  Number one entertainment platform in three years. Regime shift in North Korea in two years. Sour grapes for France as Argentinian wines expected to dominate. Euro collapse likely. Low cost space flights by 2025. No more crude oil in 15 years. Every day experts bombard us with predictions. But how reliable are they? Until a few years ago, no one bothered to check. Then along came Philip Tetlock. Over a period of 10 years, he evaluated 28,361 predictions from 284 self-appointed professionals.
-  more crude oil in 15 years. Every day, experts bombard us with predictions. But how reliable are they? Until a few years ago, no one bothered to check. Then along came Philip Tetlock. Over a period of 10 years, he evaluated 28,361 predictions from 284 self-appointed professionals. The result? In terms of accuracy, the experts compared only marginally better than a random forecast generator. Ironically, the media darlings were among the poorest performers. And of those, the worst were the prophets of doom and disintegration.
-  with interest. If he's wrong, the money goes to charity. So what is predictable and what is not? Some things are fairly simple. For example, I have a rough idea of how many pounds I will weigh in a year's time. However, the more complex a system and the longer the time frame, the more blurred the view of the future will be. Global warming, oil prices, or exchange rates are almost impossible to foresee. Inventions are not at all predictable because if we knew what technology we would invent in the future, we would already have invented it. So be critical when you encounter predictions. Whenever I hear one, I make sure to smile, no matter how bleak it is.

Whenever I hear one, I make sure to smile, no matter how bleak it is. Then I ask myself two questions. First, what incentive does the expert have? If he's an employee, could he lose his job if he's always wrong? Or is he a self-appointed guru who earns a living through books and lectures?
-  following forecast for 1983. Oil consumption will decrease by 30%. Group B heard a dramatic rise in oil prices will lead to a 30% reduction in oil consumption. Both groups had to indicate how likely they considered the scenarios. The result was clear. Group B felt much more strongly about its forecast than Group A did. Kahneman believes that two types of thinking exist. The first kind is intuitive, automatic, and direct. The second is conscious, rational, slow, laborious, and logical. Unfortunately, intuitive thinking draws conclusions.

The first kind is intuitive, automatic, and direct. The second is conscious, rational, slow, laborious, and logical. Unfortunately, intuitive thinking draws conclusions long before the conscious mind does. For example, I experienced this after the 9-11 attacks on the World Trade Center. I wanted to take out travel insurance and came across a firm that offered special terrorism cover. Although other policies
-  I automatically fell for the offer. The high point of the whole farce was that I was willing to pay even more for this enticing yet redundant add-on. In conclusion, forget about left brains and right brains. The difference between intuitive and conscious thinking is much more significant. With important decisions, remember that at the intuitive level, we have a soft spot for plausible stories. Therefore be on the lookout for convenient details and happy endings. Remember, if an additional condition has to be met, no matter how plausible it sounds, it will become less, not more likely.
-  No matter how plausible it sounds, it will become less, not more likely. 42. It's not what you say, but how you say it. Framing. Consider these two statements. Hey, the trash can is full. It would be really great if you could empty the trash, honey. C'est le ton qui fait la musique. It's not what you say, but how you say it. If a message is communicated in different ways, it will also be received in different ways. In psychologist jargon, this technique is called framing.

Kahneman and Tversky conducted a survey in the 1980s in which they put forward two options for an epidemic control strategy. The lives of 600 people were at stake, they told participants. Option A saves 200 lives. Option B offers a 33% chance that all 600 people will survive, and a 66% chance that no one will survive. Although options A and B were

Option B offers a 33% chance that all 600 people will survive and a 66% chance that no one will survive. Although options A and B were comparable, with 200 survivors expected, the majority of respondents chose A, remembering the adage, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It became really interesting when the same options were reframed.
-  lives. Option B offers a 33% chance that all 600 people will survive and a 66% chance that no one will survive. Although options A and B were comparable with 200 survivors expected, the majority of respondents chose A, remembering the adage, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It became really interesting when the same options were reframed. Option A kills 400 people. Option B offers a 33% chance that no one will die and a 66% chance that all 600 will die. This time only
-  This time, only a fraction of respondents chose A, and the majority picked B. The researchers observed a complete U-turn from almost all involved. Depending on the phrasing, survive or die, the respondents made completely different decisions. Another example, researchers presented a group of people with two kinds of meat, 99% fat-free and 1% fat, and asked them to choose which was healthier. Can you guess which they picked? Bingo! Respondents ranked the first type of meat as healthier, even though both were identical. Next came the choice between 98% fat-free and 1% fat-free.
-  99% fat free and 1% fat and asked them to choose which was healthier. Can you guess which they picked? Bingo, respondents ranked the first type of meat as healthier, even though both were identical. Next came the choice between 98% fat free and 1% fat. Again, most respondents chose the first option despite its higher fat content. Glossing is a popular type of framing. Under its rules, a tumbling share price becomes a correction. An overpaid acquisition price is branded goodwill. In every management course, a product is considered a product of the highest quality.
-  a war hero. Genocide translates to ethnic cleansing. A successful emergency landing, for example on the Hudson River, is celebrated as a triumph of aviation. Shouldn't a textbook landing on a runway count as an even bigger triumph of aviation? Have you ever looked more closely at the prospectus for financial products, for example ETFs, exchange traded funds? Generally, the brochure illustrates the product's performance in recent years, going back just far enough for the nicest possible upward curve to emerge. This is also framing. Another example is a simple piece of bread.
-  This is also framing. Another example is a simple piece of bread. Depending on how it's framed, as either the symbolic or the true body of Christ, it can split a religion, as happened in the 16th century with the Reformation. Framing is used to good effect in commerce too. Consider used cars. You're led to focus on just a few factors, whether the message is delivered through a salesman, a sign touting certain features, or even your own criteria. For example, if the car has low mileage and good tires, you home in on this and overlook the state of the engine, the brakes, or the interior. Thus, the mileage is not good.
-  Thus, the mileage and tires become the main selling points and frame our decision to buy. Such oversight is only natural, though, since it's difficult to take in all possible pros and cons. Interestingly, had other frames been used to tout the car, we might have decided very differently. Authors are conscious framers, too. A crime novel would be rather dull if, from page one, the murder was shown as it happened, stab by stab, as it were. Even though we eventually discover the motives and murder weapons, the novelist's framing injects thrills and suspense into the story. In conclusion, realize that what

In a penalty situation in soccer, the ball takes less than 0.3 seconds from the player who kicks the ball to the goal. There's not enough time for the goalkeeper to watch the ball's trajectory. He must make a decision before the ball is kicked. Soccer players who take penalty kicks shoot 1.3 of the time at the middle of the goal, 1.3 of the time at the left, and 1.3 of the time at the right.
-  You must make a decision before the ball is kicked. Soccer players who take penalty kicks shoot one-third of the time at the middle of the goal, one-third of the time at the left, and one-third of the time at the right. Surely goalkeepers have spotted this. But what do they do? They dive either to the left or to the right. Rarely do they stay standing in the middle, even though roughly a third of all balls land there. Why on earth would they jeopardize saving those penalties? The simple answer? Appearance. It looks more impressive and feels less embarrassing to dive to the wrong side than to freeze on the spot and watch the ball sail past.
-  and feels less embarrassing to dive to the wrong side than to freeze on the spot and watch the ball sail past. This is the action bias. Look active even if it achieves nothing. This study comes from the Israeli researcher Michael Bar-Elli who evaluated hundreds of penalty shootouts. But not just goalkeepers fall victim to the action bias. Suppose a group of youths exits a nightclub and begins to argue, shouting at each other and gesturing wildly. The situation is close to escalating into an all-out brawl. The police officers in the area, some young, some more senior, hold back.
-  calming presence of senior officers results in fewer casualties. The action bias is accentuated when a situation is new or unclear. When starting out, many investors act like the young gung-ho police officers outside the nightclub. They can't yet judge the stock market, so they compensate with a sort of hyperactivity. Of course, this is a waste of time. As Charlie Munger sums up his approach to investing, we've got discipline in avoiding just doing any damn thing just because you can't stand inactivity. The action bias exists even in the most educated circles. If a patient's illness can't
-  in avoiding just doing any damn thing just because you can't stand in activity. The action bias exists even in the most educated circles. If a patient's illness can't yet be diagnosed with certainty, and doctors must choose between intervening, namely prescribing something, or waiting and seeing, they're prone to take action. Such decisions have nothing to do with profiteering, but rather with the human tendency to want to do anything but sit and wait in the face of uncertainty. So what accounts for this tendency? In our old hunter-gatherer environment, which suited us quite well, action trumped reflection. Lightning

When our ancestors saw a silhouette appear at the edge of the forest, something that looked a lot like a saber-toothed tiger, they didn't take a pew to muse over what it might be. They hit the road and fast. We are the descendants of these quick responders. Back then it was better to run away once too often. However, our world today is different. It rewards reflection, even though our instincts may suggest otherwise.

Although we now value contemplation more highly, outright inaction remains a cardinal sin. You get no honor, no medal, no statue with your name on it if you make exactly the right decision by waiting, for the good of the company, the state, even humanity.

A media storm ensues, and soon you find yourself out of a job. As a civil servant or a politician, you'd do well to take the ubiquitous omission bias seriously and even foster it.

-  As a civil servant or a politician, you'd do well to take the ubiquitous omission bias seriously, and even foster it. Case law shows how ingrained such moral distortion is in our society. Active euthanasia, even if it's the explicit wish of the dying, is punishable by law, whereas deliberate refusal of life-saving measures is legal, for example, following so-called DNR orders, do not resuscitate. Such thinking also explains why parents feel it's perfectly acceptable not to vaccinate their children, even though it discernibly reduces the risk of catching the disease.

A person who is immune to the disease will never infect others. Objectively, if non-vaccinated children ever contracted one of these sicknesses, we could accuse the parents of actively harming them. But this is exactly the point. Deliberate inaction somehow seems less grave than a comparable action, say, if the parents intentionally infected them. The omission bias lies behind the following delusions. We wait until people shoot themselves in the face.

Investors and business journalists are more lenient on companies that develop no new products than they are on those that produce bad ones, even though both roads lead to ruin. Getting passively on a bunch of miserable shares feels better than actively buying bad ones. Building no emission filter into a coal plant feels superior to removing one for cost reasons.

Failing to insulate your house is more acceptable than burning the spared fuel for your own amusement. Neglecting to declare income tax is less immoral than faking tax documents, even though the state loses out either way. In the previous chapter, we met the action bias.

Do you ever read annual reports paying particular attention to the CEO's comments? No, that's a pity because there you'll find countless examples of this next error, which we all fall for at one time or another. For example, if the company has enjoyed an excellent year, the CEO catalogs his indispensable contributions, his brilliant decisions, tireless efforts, and cultivating his own business.
-  For example, if the company has enjoyed an excellent year, the CEO catalogs his indispensable contributions, his brilliant decisions, tireless efforts, and cultivation of a dynamic corporate culture. However, if the company has had a miserable year, we read about all sorts of other dynamics â the unfortunate exchange rate, governmental interference, the malicious trade practices of the Chinese, various hidden tariffs, subdued consumer confidence, and so on. In short, we attribute success to ourselves and failures to external factors. This is the self-serving bias. Even if you've never heard the expression,
-  But if it disappears in the flood of new releases, it's because the readers simply don't recognize good literature when they see it. And if the critics slay it, it's clearly a case of jealousy. To investigate this bias, researchers put together a personality test and afterward allocated the participants good or bad scores at random. Those who got scored highly found the test thorough and fair. Low scorers rated it completely useless. So why do we attribute success to our own skill and ascribe failure to other factors? There are many theories. The simplest explanation is probably this. It feels good.

But beware, in a modern world with many hidden risks, the self-serving bias can quickly lead to catastrophe.

Interestingly, they're neither lying nor exaggerating, they're simply enhancing the result a little, until they start to believe the new score themselves.

I meet them now and again in the elevator and I decided to ask them separately how often they take out the trash. One said he did it every second time, another every third time. Roommate number three, cursing because his garbage bag had split, reckoned he did it pretty much every time, say 90 percent. Although their answers should have added up to 100 percent, these boys achieved an impressive 320 percent. The five systematically overestimated their roles and so are no different from any of us.

Do you have friends who tell you the truth, no holds barred? If so, consider yourself lucky. If not, do you have at least one enemy? Good. Invite him or her over for coffee, and ask for an honest opinion about your strengths and weaknesses. You'll be forever grateful you did.

Suppose one day the phone rings and excited voice tells you that you've just scooped the lottery jackpot, ten million dollars. How would you feel and how long would you feel like that? Another scenario the phone rings and you learn that your best friend has passed away Again, how would you feel and for how long? in chapter 40 false prophets
-  in the fields of politics, economics, and social events. We concluded that self-appointed experts are of no more use than a random forecast generator. So moving on to a new area, how well can we predict our feelings? Are we experts on ourselves? Would winning the lottery make us the happiest people alive for years to come? Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says no. He studied lottery winners and discovered that the happiness effect fizzles out after a few months. So a little while after you receive the big check, you'll be as content or as discontent as you were before. He calls this effective forecast.
-  After you receive the big check, you'll be as content or as discontent as you were before. He calls this effective forecasting, our inability to correctly predict our own emotions. A friend, a banking executive, whose enormous income was beginning to burn a hole in his pocket, decided to build himself a new home away from the city. His dream materialized into a villa with 10 rooms, a swimming pool, and an enviable view of the lake and mountains. For the first few weeks, he beamed with delight. But soon the cheerfulness disappeared, and six months later he was unhappier than ever. What happened?
-  presents a major source of discontent and stress, and people hardly ever get used to it. In other words, whoever has no innate affinity for commuting will suffer every day, twice a day. Anyhow, the moral of the story is that the dream villa had an overall negative effect on my friend's happiness. Many others fare no better. People who change or progress in their careers are, in terms of happiness, right back where they started after around three months. The same goes for people who buy the latest Porsche. Science calls this effect the hedonic treadmill. We work hard, advance, and are able to afford more and nicer things, and yet this
-  We work hard, advance, and are able to afford more and nicer things, and yet this doesn't make us any happier. So how do negative events affect us? Perhaps a spinal cord injury, or the loss of a friend? Here, we also overestimate the duration and intensity of future emotions. For example, when a relationship ends, it feels like life will never be the same. The afflicted are completely convinced that they'll never again experience joy. But after three or so months, they're back on the dating scene. Wouldn't it be nice if we knew exactly how happy a new car, career, or relationship would make us?
-  to make better, brighter decisions. A, avoid negative things that you cannot grow accustomed to, such as commuting, noise, or chronic stress. B, expect only short-term happiness from material things, such as cars, houses, lottery winnings, bonuses, and prizes. C, aim for as much free time and autonomy as possible, since long-lasting positive effects generally come from what you actively do. Follow your passions, even if you must forfeit a portion of your income for them. Invest in friendships. For most people, professional status achieves long-lasting happiness, as long as you are able to do so.

Glancing to the opposite side of the road, I saw carefree southbound drivers racing past with enviable speed. As I spent the next hour crawling forward at a snail's pace and started to grow restless from braking and accelerating, I asked myself whether I really was especially unlucky. Do I always pick the worst line to drive?
-  forward at a snail's pace and started to grow restless from breaking and accelerating, I asked myself whether I really was especially unlucky. Do I always pick the worst lines at the bank, post office and grocery store? Or do I just think I do? Suppose that on this highway, a traffic jam develops 10% of the time. The probability that I'll get stuck in a jam on a particular day is not greater than the probability that one will occur. However, the likelihood that I will get stuck at a certain point in my journey is greater than 10%. The reason? Because I can only crawl forward when in a traffic jam, I spend a disproportionate amount

In this case, you'd spend 99.99%, not 10% of your total journey time waiting and cursing in front of red traffic lights. Whenever we complain about bad luck, we must be wary of the so-called self- selection bias.

The self-selection bias is pervasive. Marketers sometimes stumble into the trap in this way. To analyze how much customers value their newsletter they send out a questionnaire. Unfortunately this reaches only one group. Current subscribers who are clearly satisfied have time to respond and have not canceled their subscriptions. The others make up no part of the sample.

Kevin has presented his division's results to the company's board on three different occasions. Each time, things have gone perfectly. And each time, he's worn his green polka dot boxer shorts. It's official, he thinks. These are my lucky underpants. The girl in the jewelry store was so stunning that Kevin couldn't help buying the $10,000 engagement ring she showed.

Since then, he's always felt uncomfortable on very warm days. If the temperature starts to heat up around one of his checkups, he cancels right away. Our brain is a connection machine. This is quite practical. If we eat an unknown fruit and feel sick afterward, we avoid it in the future, labeling the plant poisonous or at least unpalatable. This is how knowledge comes to be. However, this method also creates false knowledge.
-  sick afterward we avoided in the future, labeling the plant poisonous or at least unpalatable. This is how knowledge comes to be. However, this method also creates false knowledge. Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov was the first to conduct research into this phenomenon. His original goal was to measure salivation in dogs. He used a bell to call the dogs to eat. But soon the ringing sound was enough to make the dogs salivate. The animal's brains linked two functionally unrelated things, the ringing of a bell and the production of saliva. Pavlov's method works equally well with humans. Advertising creates a link between products.

Advertising creates a link between products and emotions. For this reason, you'll never see a coke alongside a frowning face or a wrinkly body. Coke people are young, beautiful and oh so fun and they appear in clusters not seen in the real world. These false connections are the work of the association bias, which also influences the quality of our decisions. For example,
-  bias, which also influences the quality of our decisions. For example, we often condemn bearers of bad news since we automatically associate them with the message's content, otherwise known as shoot the messenger syndrome. Sometimes CEOs and investors unconsciously steer clear of these harbingers, meaning the only news that reaches the upper echelons is positive, thus creating a distorted view of the real situation. If you lead a group of people and don't want to fall prey to false connections, direct your staff to tell you only the bad news, and fast. With this, you overcompensate for the shoot the messenger syndrome.
-  In the days before email and telemarketing, traveling salesmen went door to door peddling their wares. One day, a particular salesman, George Foster, stood at a front door. The house transpired to be vacant, and unbeknownst to him, a tiny leak had been filling it with gas for weeks. The bell was also damaged, so when he pressed it, it created a spark, and the house exploded. Poor George ended up in the hospital, But fortunately, he was soon back on his feet. Unfortunately, his fear of ringing doorbells had become so strong that he couldn't carry out his job for many years.
-  his fear of ringing doorbells had become so strong that he couldn't carry out his job for many years. He knew how unlikely a repeat of the incident was, but for all he tried he just couldn't manage to reverse the false emotional connection. The take-home message from all this is phrased most aptly by Mark Twain, we should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again and that as well, but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.

In the last chapter we learned about the association bias, the tendency to see connections where none exist. For example, regardless of how many big presentations he's nailed while wearing them, Kevin's green polka dot underpants are no guarantee of success.

The merger proves too difficult to handle. The estimated synergy is impossible to realize.

The same goes for the stock exchange. Driven by initial success, many investors pumped their life savings into Internet stocks in the late 90s. Some even took out loans to capitalize on the opportunity. However, these investors overlooked one tiny detail. Their amazing profits at the time had nothing to do with their stock picking abilities. The market was simply on an upward spiral. Even the most clueless investors won big. When the market

There is no clear rule, but these two tips may help. First, if you're much better than others over a long period of time, you can be fairly sure that talent plays a part. Unfortunately, you can never be 100% sure, though. Second, the more people competing, the greater the chances are that one of them will repeatedly strike lucky. Perhaps even you. If among 10 competitors you establish yourself as a market leader over many years, you can clap yourself on the back. That's a sure indication of your luck.

But if you're top dog among 10 million players, namely in the financial markets, you shouldn't start visualizing a Buffett-esque financial empire just yet. It's extremely likely that you have simply been very fortunate. Watch and wait before you draw any conclusions. Beginner's luck can be devastating, so guard against misconceptions by treating your theories as a scientist would. Try to disprove them. As my first novel, 35, was ready to go,

He placed his front paws against the trunk of the vine, stretched his neck, and tried to get at the fruit, but it was too high. Irritated, he tried his luck again. He launched himself upward, but his jaw snapped only at fresh air. A third time he leapt with all his might, so powerfully as to get to the top.

These aren't even ripe yet. Why would I want sour grapes? Holding his head high, he strode back into the forest. The Greek poet Aesop created this fable to illustrate one of the most common errors in reasoning. An inconsistency arose when the fox set out to do something and failed to accomplish it.

And anyway, the dealer probably wouldn't refund all the money. So, you tell yourself that a loud engine and awkward seats are great safety features that will prevent you from falling asleep at the wheel. Not so stupid after all, you think, and you're suddenly proud of your sound, practical purchase.
-  the situation, so did they. The students who received more didn't have to justify anything. They had lied and netted $20 for it. A fair deal. They experienced no cognitive dissonance. Suppose you apply for a job and discover you've lost out to another candidate. Instead of admitting that the other person was better suited, you convince yourself that you didn't want the job in the first place. You simply wanted to test your market value and see if you could get invited for an interview. I reacted very similarly some time ago when I had to choose between investing in two different stocks. My chosen stock lost much of its value shortly after the purchase.
-  value shortly after the purchase, whereas shares in the other stock, the one I hadn't invested in, skyrocketed. I couldn't bring myself to admit my error. Quite the reverse, in fact. I distinctly remember trying to convince a friend that, though the stock was experiencing teething problems, it still had more potential overall. Only cognitive dissonance can explain this remarkably irrational reaction. The potential would indeed have been greater if I had postponed the decision to purchase the shares until today. It was that friend who told me the ESOP fable. You can play the clever fox all you want, but you'll never get the grapes that way.
-  What do you do? You probably leave a tip as well. Social proof, sometimes roughly termed the herd instinct, dictates that individuals feel they're behaving correctly when they act the same as other people. In other words, the more people who follow a certain idea, the better or truer we deem the idea to be. And the more people who display a certain behavior, the more appropriate this behavior is judged by others. This is, of course, absurd. Social proof is the evil behind bubbles and stock market panic. It exists in fashion, management techniques, hobbies, religion, and culture.

-  interest rates, banks charge on credit card debt, and other short-term personal loans, both of which exploit our must-have-now instincts. In conclusion, though instantaneous reward is incredibly tempting, hyperbolic discounting is still a flaw. The more power we gain over our impulses, the better we can avoid this trap. The less power we have over our impulses, for example, when we're under the influence of alcohol, the more susceptible we are. From the other side, if you sell consumer products, give customers the option of getting their hands on the items right away. Some people will be willing to pay extra just so they don't have to wait. Amazon makes a bundle from this.

-  Strangely enough, my level of frustration was much lower this time. Why? Reassuringly cheerful signs along the road announced, we're renovating the highway for you. The jam reminded me of an experiment conducted by the Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer in the 1970s. For this, she went into a library and waited at a photocopier until a line had formed. Then she approached the first in line and said, excuse me, I have found a way to get to the library. Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine? Her success rate was 60%. She repeated the experiment, this time giving a reason. Excuse me.

Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I'm in a rush? In almost all cases, 94%, she was allowed to go ahead. This is understandable. If people are in a hurry, you often let them cut into the front of the line.
-  yet another approach, this time saying, excuse me, I have five pages, may I go before you because I have to make some copies? The result was amazing, even though the pretext was, ahem, paper thin, after all, everyone was standing in line to make copies, she was allowed to pass to the front of the line in almost all cases, 93%. When you justify your behavior, you encounter more tolerance and helpfulness. It seems to matter very little if your excuse is good or not. Using the simple validation, because, is sufficient. A sign proclaiming, we're renovating the highway for you, is completely redundant.
-  The word greases the wheels of human interaction. Use it unrestrainedly. 53. Decide better, decide less. Decision fatigue. For weeks, you've been working to the point of exhaustion on this presentation. The PowerPoint slides are polished. Each figure in Excel is indisputable. The pitch is a paradigm of crystal clear logic. Everything depends on your presentation. If you get the green light from the CEO, you're on your way to a corner office. If the presentation flops, you're on your way to the unemployment office.
-  presentation flops, you're on your way to the unemployment office. The CEO's assistant proposes the following times for the presentation 8 a.m., 1130 a.m., or 6 p.m. Which slot do you choose? The psychologist Roy Baumeister and collaborator Gene Twenke once covered a table with hundreds of inexpensive items from tennis balls and candles to t-shirts chewing gum and coke cans. He divided his students into two groups. The first group he labeled deciders, the second nondeciders. He told the first group, I'm going to show you sets containing two random items and each time you have to decide
-  Psychologist Roy Baumeister and collaborator Gene Twenke once covered a table with hundreds of inexpensive items, from tennis balls and candles to T-shirts, chewing gum, and Coke cans. He divided his students into two groups. The first group he labeled deciders. The second, non-deciders. He told the first group, I'm going to show you sets containing two random items, and each time you have to decide which you prefer. At the end of the experiment, I'll give you one item you can take home. They were led to believe that their choices would influence them which item they get to keep. To the second group he said, write down what you think about each item, and I'll pick one.
-  they get to keep. To the second group he said, write down what you think about each item and I'll pick one and give it to you at the end. Immediately thereafter he asked each student to put their hand in ice cold water and hold it there as long as possible. In psychology, this is a classic method to measure willpower or self-discipline. If you have little or none, you yank your hand back out of the water very quickly. The result? The deciders pulled their hands out of the icy water much sooner than the non-deciders did. The intensive decision-making had drained their willpower, an effect confirmed in many other experiments. Making decisions is exhausting. Anyone
-  you yank your hand back out of the water very quickly. The result? The deciders pulled their hands out of the icy water much sooner than the non-deciders did. The intensive decision-making had drained their willpower, an effect confirmed in many other experiments. Making decisions is exhausting. Anyone who has ever configured a laptop online or researched a long trip flight, hotels, activities, restaurants, weather, knows this well. After all the comparing, considering and choosing, you're exhausted. Science calls this decision fatigue. Decision fatigue is perilous. As a consumer you become more susceptible to advertising.

How did the judges decide? More significant than the detainee's allegiance or the severity of their crimes was the judge's decision fatigue. The judges granted requests one and two because their blood sugar was still high from breakfast or lunch. However, they struck out applications three and four because they couldn't summon enough energy to risk the consequences of an early release. They took option.
-  from breakfast or lunch. However, they struck out applications three and four because they couldn't summon enough energy to risk the consequences of an early release. They took the easy option, the status quo, and the men remained in jail. A study of hundreds of verdicts shows that within a session, the percentage of courageous judicial decisions gradually drops from 65% to almost zero, and after a recess, returns to 65%. So much for the careful deliberations of Lady Justice. But as long as you have no upcoming trials, all is not lost. You now know when to present your project to the CEO.
-  Breathing, I asked, about a billion per breath. His cough got even worse. 55, why there is no such thing as an average war? The problem with averages. Suppose you're on a bus with 49 other people. At the next stop, the heaviest person in America gets on. Question, by how much has the average weight of the passengers increased? 4%, 5%, something like that? Suppose the bus stops again and on gets Bill Gates. This time we're not concerned about weight. Question.
-  Well, in the past, following others was a good survival strategy. Suppose that 50,000 years ago you were traveling around the Serengeti with your hunter-gatherer friends and suddenly they all bolted. What would you have done? Would you have stayed put, scratching your head and weighing up whether what you were looking at was a lion or something that just looked like a lion but was in fact a harmless animal that could serve as a great protein source? No, you would have sprinted after your friends. Later on when you were safe, you could have reflected on what had actually happened. Those who acted differently, and I'm sure there were some, exited the gene pool.
-  The average wealth has just shot up to $1.15 billion, an increase of more than 2 million percent. A single outlier has radically altered the picture, rendering the term average completely meaningless. Don't cross a river if it is, on average, four feet deep, warns Nassim Taleb, from whom I have the above examples. The river can be very shallow for long distances, and the river can be very shallow for long distances. It can be very shallow for long stretches, mere inches, but it might transform into a raging torrent that's 20 feet deep in the middle, in which case you could easily drown.
-  gather her friends and suddenly they all bolted. What would you have done? Would you have stayed put scratching your head and weighing up whether what you were looking at was a lion or something that just looked like a lion but was in fact a harmless animal that could serve as a great protein source? No, you would have sprinted after your friends. Later on when you were safe you could have reflected on what had actually happened. Those who acted differently and I'm sure there were some, exited the gene pool. We are the direct heirs of those who copied the other's behavior. This pattern is so deeply rooted in us that we still use it today even when it offers no
-  in a darkened office, then fly to Barbados and lie in the sun without sunscreen for a week solid, you'd have a problem. Even though on average over the summer, you were not getting more UV light than someone who was regularly outside. All this is quite straightforward and maybe you were aware of it already. For example, you drink one glass of red wine for dinner every evening. That's not a health issue. Many doctors recommend it. But if you drink no alcohol the entire year and on December 31st you gulp 356 glasses, which is equivalent to 60 bottles, you will have a problem. Although the average over the year is the same.
-  countless other pages draw comparatively few. In such cases, mathematicians speak of the so-called Power Law. Take cities. There is one city on this planet with a population of more than 30 million, Tokyo. There are 11 cities with a population of between 20 and 30 million. There are 15 cities with a population of between 10 and 20 million. There are 48 cities between 5 and 10 million inhabitants, and thousands between 1 and 5 million. That's a Power Law. A few extremes dominate the distribution, and the concept of average is rendered worthless. What's the answer?
-  What's the average book sell? What's the average amount of damage a hurricane wreaks? What's a banker's average bonus? What's the average success of a marketing campaign? How many downloads does an average iPhone app get? How much money does an average actor earn? Of course you can calculate the answers, but it would be a waste of time. These seemingly routine scenarios are subject to the power law. To use just the final example, a handful of actors take home more than $10 million per year, while thousands and thousands live on the breadline. Would you advise your son or daughter to get into acting since the average wage is pretty decent? Hopefully not.
-  The future is already here. It's just not very evenly distributed. 56. How bonuses destroy motivation. Motivation crowding. A few months ago, a friend from Connecticut decided to move to New York City. This man had a fabulous collection of antiques, such as exquisite old books and hand-blown Murano glasses from generations ago. I knew how attached he was to them, and how anxious he would be handing them over to a moving company. So the last time I visited, I offered to carry the most fragile items with me when I went to New York.
-  radioactive waste. The authorities considered a few different locations for the underground repository, including the village of Wolfenscheisen in the center of the country. Economist Bruno Frey and his fellow researchers at the University of Zurich traveled there and recorded people's opinions at a community meeting. Surprisingly, 50.8% were in favor of the proposal. Their positive response can be attributed to several factors. National pride, common decency, social obligation, the prospect of new jobs, and so on. The team carried out the survey a second time, but this time they mentioned a hypothetical reason.

Parents collecting their children after closing time. The staff has no choice but to wait. They can hardly put the last remaining children in taxis or leave them on the curb. To discourage parental tardiness, many nurseries introduced fees for lateness. Ironically,

The staff has no choice but to wait. They can hardly put the last remaining children in taxis or leave them on the curb. To discourage parental tardiness, many nurseries introduced fees for lateness. Ironically, studies showed that tardiness actually increased. Of course, they could have instituted a draconian penalty of, say, $500 for each hour, as they could have offered $1 million to each citizen of the small Swiss village. But that's beside the point.
-  others behavior. This pattern is so deeply rooted in us that we still use it today, even when it offers no survival advantage. Only a few cases come to mind where social proof is of value. For example, if you find yourself hungry in a foreign city and don't know a good restaurant, it makes sense to pick the one that's full of locals. In other words, you copy the locals behavior. Comedy and talk shows make use of social proof by inserting canned laughter at strategic spots inciting the audience to laugh along. One of the most impressive, though troubling, cases of this phenomenon is the famous speech by Nazi propaganda minister
-  in penalty of, say, $500 for each hour, as they could have offered $1 million to each citizen of the small Swiss village. But that's beside the point. The point is, small, surprisingly small monetary incentives crowd out other types of incentives. The three stories illustrate one thing. Money does not always motivate. Indeed, in many cases, it does just the opposite. When my friend slit me that 50, he undermined my good deed and also tainted our friendship. The offer of compensation for the nuclear repository was perceived as a bribe and cheapened the community in patriotic spirit.

When people do something for well-meaning non-monetary reasons, out of the goodness of their hearts so to speak, payments throw a wrench into the works. Financial reward erodes any other motivations. Suppose you run a nonprofit organization. Logically the wages you pay are quite modest. Nevertheless your employees are highly motivated because they believe they're making a difference. If you suddenly introduce a bonus system let's say a small salary increase for every donation secured, motivation crowding will commence. Your team will begin to snub tasks that bring no extra

So who is safe from motivation crowding? This tip should help. Do you know any private bankers, insurance agents, or financial auditors who do their jobs out of passion, or who believe in a higher mission? I don't. Financial incentives and performance bonuses work well in industries with generally uninspiring jobs. Industries where employees aren't proud of the products or the companies and do the work successfully.

On the other hand, if you create a startup, you would be wise to enlist employee enthusiasm to promote the company's endeavor, rather than try to entice employees with juicy bonuses, which you couldn't pay anyway. One final tip for those of you who have children. Experience shows that young people are not for sale. If you want your kids to do their homework, practice musical instruments, or even mow the lawn once in a while, don't reach for your wallet. Instead, give them a fixed amount of pocket money each week. Otherwise, they'll exploit the system and soon refuse to go to bed without recompense.

When asked why a fifth of Americans were unable to locate their country on a world map, Miss Teen South Carolina, a high school graduate, gave this answer in front of rolling cameras. I personally believe that US Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have maps and I believe that our education

Will Rogers Phenomenon Let's say you run a small private bank. The bank manages the money of wealthy and mostly retired individuals. Two money managers, A and B, report to you. Money manager A manages the money of a few ultra-high net worth individuals. Money manager B has rich but not extravagantly rich clients to deal with.

Money manager A manages the money of a few ultra high net worth individuals. Money manager B has rich but not extravagantly rich clients to deal with. The board asks you to increase the average pool of money of both A and B within six months. If you succeed, you receive a handsome bonus. If not, they'll find someone else to do it. Where do you start?
-  within six months. If you succeed, you receive a handsome bonus. If not, they'll find someone else to do it. Where do you start? It's quite simple actually. You take a client with a sizable but not a huge pool of money from A and give it to B instead. In one fell swoop, this brings up A's average managed wealth as well as B's without you having to find a single new client. The only remaining question is, how will you spend your bonus? Suppose you switch careers and are now in charge of three hedge funds that invest primarily in privately held companies. Fund A has sensational

You move a few of A's shares to B and C, picking exactly those investments that have been pulling down A's average returns, but which are still profitable enough to fortify B and C. In no time all three funds look much healthier and because the transformation happened in-house, you don't incur a single fee. Of course the combined value of the trio hasn't risen by a single cent, but people will still pat you on the back.

Of course, the combined value of the trio hasn't risen by a single cent, but people will still pat you on the back. This effect is called stage migration, or the Will Rogers phenomenon, named after an American comedian from Oklahoma. He is said to have joked that Oklahomans who pack up and move to California raise both states average IQ. Since we rarely recognize such scenarios, let's drill the Will Rogers phenomenon to anchor it in your memory.
-  anonymously, it's likely that nobody would have consented to this crazy proposal. The advertising industry benefits greatly from our weakness for social proof. This works well when a situation is unclear, such as deciding among various car-makes, cleaning products, beauty products, and so on, with no obvious advantages or disadvantages, and where people like you and me appear. So be skeptical whenever a company claims its product is better because it's the most popular. How is a product better? Simply because it sells the most units. And remember English novelist W. Somerset Maugham's wise words,
-  rising averages in countries, companies, departments, cost centers, or product lines. A particularly deceitful case of the Will Rogers phenomenon is found in medicine. Tumors are usually broken down in four stages. The smallest and most treatable ones are classified as stage one. The worst are rated stage four. Their progression gives us the term stage migration. The survival rate is highest for stage one patients and lowest for stage four patients. Now every year new procedures are released under the market and allow for more accurate diagnosis.

In his short story, Del Rigor en la Ciencia, which consists of just a single paragraph, Jorge Luis Borges describes a special country. In this country, the science of cartography is so sophisticated that only the most detailed of maps will do. That is, a map with a scale of one to one, as large as the country itself.

In this country, the science of cartography is so sophisticated that only the most detailed of maps will do. That is, a map with a scale of one-to-one, as large as the country itself. Their citizens soon realize that such a map does not provide any insight, since it merely duplicates what they already know. Borges' map is the extreme case of the information bias, the delusion that more information
-  While in Miami, a little while ago, I drew up a short list of five good offers. Right away, one jumped out at me. But I wanted to make sure I had found the best deal and decided to keep researching. I plowed my way through dozens of customer reviews and blog posts and clicked through countless photos and videos. Two hours later, I could say for sure which the best hotel was. The one I had liked at the start. The mountain of additional information did not lead to a better decision. On the contrary, if time is money, then I might as well have taken up residence at the Four Seasons. John Barron from the University of Pennsylvania
-  the one I had liked at the start. The mountain of additional information did not lead to a better decision. On the contrary, if time is money, then I might as well have taken up residence at the Four Seasons. John Barron from the University of Pennsylvania asked physicians the following question. A patient presents symptoms that indicate with a probability of 80% that he is suffering from disease A. If this is not the case, the patient has either disease X or Y. Each of these diseases is equally bad, and each treatment results in similar side effects. As a doctor, what treatment would you suggest?

If this is not the case, the patient has either disease X or Y. Each of these diseases is equally bad, and each treatment results in similar side effects. As a doctor, what treatment would you suggest? Logically, you would opt for disease A and recommend the relevant therapy. Now suppose there is a diagnostic test that flashes positive when disease X is present and negative when disease Y is detected.

The additional information contributes nothing of value to the decision. Doctors are not the only professionals with a pension for surplus information.
-  W. Somerset Mom's wise words. If 50 million people say something foolish, it's still foolish. Five, why you should forget the past, sunk cost fallacy. The film was dire. After an hour, I whispered to my wife, come on, let's go home. She replied, no way, we're not throwing away $30. That's no reason to stay, I protested. The money's already gone. This is the sunk cost fallacy at work, a thinking error. She glared at me as if she had just bitten off a piece of lemon. Okay, I sometimes go.
-  Every weekend and holiday went into getting it up and running. All the while his marriage was approaching breakdown. It was a struggle, but finally Mark's prized possession was road ready and gleamed in the sunshine. Two years later, Mark desperately needs money. He sells all his possessions, the TV, the car, even his house, but not the bike. Even when a prospect offers double the actual value, Mark does not sell it. John and Mark are victims of effort justification. When you put a lot of energy into a task, you tend to overvalue the result. Because John had to endure physical pain for the parachute pin.

When you put a lot of energy into a task, you tend to overvalue the result. Because John had to endure physical pain for the parachute pin, it outshines all his other rewards. And since Mark's Harley cost him so many hours, and also nearly his wife, he prizes the bike so highly that he will never sell it.
-  it outshines all his other rewards. And since Mark's Harley cost him so many hours, and also nearly his wife, he prizes the bike so highly that he will never sell it. Effort justification is a special case of cognitive dissonance. To have a hole punched in your chest for a simple merit badge borders on the absurd. John's brain compensates for this imbalance by overvaluing the pin, hyping it up from something mundane to something semi-sacred. All of this happens unconsciously and is difficult to prevent. Groups use effort justification to bind members to them. For example, through initiation rites.

A mild form of effort justification is the so-called IKEA effect. Furniture that we assemble ourselves seems more valuable than any expensive designer piece. The same goes for hand-knitted socks. To throw away a handcrafted pair, even if they're tatty and outdated, is hard to do. Managers who put weeks of hard work into a strategy proposal will be incapable of appraising it objectively.

The added effort raised the ladies sense of achievement and with it their appreciation for convenience food. Now that you know about effort justification you can rate your projects more objectively. Try it out. When you've invested a lot of time and effort into something stand back and examine the result only the result. The novel you've been tinkering with for five years and that no publisher wants perhaps it's not Nobel worthy after all. The MBA you felt compelled to do.

Half of the stores are in cities, the other half in rural areas. At the behest of the CEO, a consultant conducted a study on shoplifting and is now presenting his findings. Projected onto the wall in front are the names of the 100 branches with the highest theft rates compared to sales.

-  The branches with the highest theft rate are primarily in rural areas. After a moment of silence and disbelief, the CEO is first to speak. Ladies and gentlemen, the next steps are clear. From now on, we'll install additional safety systems in all rural branches. Let's see those hillbillies steal from us then, eh? Do we all agree? Not completely. You ask the consultant to call up the hundred branches with the lowest theft rates. After some swift sorting, the list appears. Surprise, surprise, the shops with the least amount of shoplifting in relation to sales are also in rural areas.

-  The location isn't the deciding factor, you begin, smiling somewhat smugly as you gaze around the table at your colleagues. What counts is the size of the store. In the countryside, the branches tend to be small, meaning a single incident has a much larger influence on the theft rate. Therefore, the rural branches' rates vary greatly, much more than the larger city branches. Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you the law of small numbers. It has just caught you out. The law of small numbers is not something we understand intuitively. Thus, people, especially journalists, managers and board members, continually fall for it.

It has just caught you out. The law of small numbers is not something we understand intuitively. Thus, people, especially journalists, managers, and board members, continually fall for it. Let's examine an extreme example. Instead of the theft rate, consider the average weight of employees in a branch. Instead of a thousand stores, we'll take just two, a mega branch and a mini branch. The big store has 1,000 employees.
-  and new businesses the highest and lowest scores. The National Institute study has zero significance. It simply confirms the laws of chance. So watch out when you hear remarkable statistics about any small entities, businesses, households, cities, data centers, anthills, parishes, schools, and so on. What's being peddled as an astounding finding is in fact a humdrum consequence of random distribution. In his latest book, Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman reveals that even experienced scientists succumb to the law of small numbers. How reassuring.
-  the scent and so must draw on all the accounting artifices available. Fortunately, expectations can also lead to commendable incentives. In 1965, the American psychologist Robert Rosenthal conducted a noteworthy experiment in various schools. Teachers were told of a fake new test that could identify students who were on the verge of an intellectual spurt, so-called bloomers. 20% of students were randomly selected and classified as such. Teachers remained under the impression that these were indeed high potential students. After a year, Rosenthal discovered that these students had developed much higher IQs than other children in the world.
-  that these were indeed high potential students. After a year, Rosenthal discovered that these students had developed much higher IQs than other children in a control group. This effect became known as the Rosenthal effect, or Pygmalion effect. Unlike the CEOs and CFOs who consciously tailor their performance to meet expectations, the teachers' actions were subconscious. Unknowingly, they probably devoted more time to the bloomers, and consequently the group learned more. The prospect of brilliant students influenced the teachers so much that they ascribed not just better grades, but also improved personality.
-  and consequently the group learned more. The prospect of brilliant students influenced the teachers so much that they ascribed not just better grades, but also improved personality traits to the gifted students. But how do we react to personal expectations? This brings us to the placebo effect, pills and therapies that are unlikely to improve health, but do so anyway. The placebo effect has been registered in one third of all patients. But how it works is not well understood. All we know is that expectations alter the biochemistry of the brain, and thus the whole body.
-  Expectations are intangible, but their effect is quite real. They have the power to change reality. Can we deprogram them? Is it possible to live a life free from expectations? Unfortunately not. But you can deal with them more cautiously. Raise expectations for yourself and for the people you love. This increases motivation. At the same time, lower expectations for things you cannot control. For example, the stock market. As paradoxical as it sounds, the best way to shield yourself from nasty surprises is to anticipate them.
-  it'll all have been for nothing. Another victim of the sunk cost fallacy. A friend struggled for years in a troubled relationship. His girlfriend cheated on him time and again. Each time she came back repentant and begged for forgiveness. He explained it to me this way. I've invested so much energy in the relationship, it would be wrong to throw it away. A classic case of the sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy is most dangerous when we've invested a lot of time, money, energy or love in something. This investment becomes a reason to carry on, even if we're dealing with a lost cause.
-  Three easy questions. Grab a pen quickly and jot down your answers in the margin. First question. In a department store a ping pong paddle and a plastic ball cost a dollar ten. If the paddle costs one dollar more, how much is the ball? Second question. In a textile factory five machines take exactly five minutes to make five shirts. How many minutes will it take 100 machines to produce 100 shirts? And the third question. A pond has water lilies growing in it. The flowers multiply quickly, each day doubling the area they take up. If it takes
-  Would you rather have $3,400 now or $3,800 in a month? In general, people with the low CRT scores favor getting the smaller amount sooner. For them, waiting poses a challenge because they're more impulsive. This also applies to purchasing decisions. In contrast, people with high CRT results usually decide to wait the extra few weeks. They muster the willpower to turn down instant gratification and are rewarded for it later on.
-  impulsive. This also applies to purchasing decisions. In contrast, people with high CRT results usually decide to wait the extra few weeks. They muster the willpower to turn down instant gratification and are rewarded for it later on. Thinking is more exhausting than sensing. Rational consideration requires more willpower than simply giving in to intuition. In other words, intuitive people tend to scrutinize less. This led Harvard psychologist Amitai Shenhov and his research colleagues to investigate whether people's CRT results correlate with their faith.
-  I've invested so much energy in the relationship, it would be wrong to throw it away. A classic case of the sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy is most dangerous when we've invested a lot of time, money, energy or love in something. This investment becomes a reason to carry on even if we're dealing with a lost cause. The more we invest, the greater the sunk costs are and the greater the urge to continue becomes. Profits frequently fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. Often they base their trading decisions on acquisition prices. I lost so much money with this stock I can't sell it now. They say.
-  This led Harvard psychologist Amitai Shenhov and his research colleagues to investigate whether people's CRT results correlate with their faith. Americans with a high CRT score, the study was conducted only in the United States, are often atheists, and their convictions have been reinforced over the years. Participants with low CRT results, however, tend to believe in God and the immortality of the soul, and often have had divine experiences. This makes sense. The more intuitively people make decisions, the less rationally they query religious beliefs. If you're less than pleased, then you're more than welcome to participate.
-  intuitively people make decisions, the less rationally they query religious beliefs. If you're less than pleased with your CRT score and want to improve it, start by greeting even the simplest logical questions with incredulity. Not everything that seems plausible is true. Reject the easy answers that pop into your head. So one more try. You're traveling from A to B. On the way there, you drive at 100 miles per hour, and on the way back at 50 miles per hour. What was your average speed? 75 miles per hour? Slow down. Slow down.

At times you're extroverted, affable, and sociable, while at other times you're introverted, wary, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. Security is one of your major goals in life. Do you recognize yourself? On a scale from one, poor, to five, excellent. How was my assessment? In 1948, psychologist Bertram Forer crafted this exact passage using astrology columns from various magazines. He then gave it to his students to read.

Jack, a photographer, is on the go from Monday to Friday. Commissioned by fashion magazines, he divides his time between Milan, Paris, and New York and is constantly in search of the most beautiful girls, the most original designs, and the perfect light.

He's well known on the social circuit, and the money is great. $500 an hour. Easy. That's as much as a commercial lawyer, he brags to his buddies, and what I have in front of my lens looks a lot better than any banker. Jack leads an enviable life, but lately he's become more philosophical. It feels as if something has come between him.
-  Do you have any time? We're meeting at 8 o'clock in the morning. We should be done shortly afternoon. What would Jack say if he really is serious about creating a better world? That's right. He should turn down the request. Why? Jack earns $500 an hour. A carpenter, $50. It would be much more sensible to work an extra hour as a photographer and then hire a professional carpenter for six hours to make good quality birdhouses, which Jack could never hope to accomplish. Taxes aside, he could donate the difference, $200, to the Bird Club. Doing so, his contribution would go much further.
-  What counts is the stock's future performance, and the future performance of alternative investments. Ironically, the more money a share loses, the more investors tend to stick by it. This irrational behavior is driven by a need for consistency. After all, consistency signifies credibility. We find contradictions abominable. If we decide to cancel a project halfway through, we create a contradiction. We admit that we once thought differently. Continuing on with a meaningless project delays this painful realization and keeps up appearances. The Concord is a prime example of a government deficit.

Simply speaking, anyone who profits or feels even the slightest satisfaction from volunteering is not a pure altruist. So does it mean Jack is a fool if he turns up, hammering

Trust your internal observations too much and too long, and you might be in for a very rude awakening.

We mere mortals do everything we can to keep open the maximum number of options. Psychology professors Dan Errally and Ji Weng-Shin demonstrated the strength of this instinct using a computer game. Players started with 100 points and on the screen in front of them, three doors appeared. A red one, a blue one and a green one. Opening a door cost a point, but for every room they entered, they could accrue more points.

Players started with 100 points and on the screen in front of them, three doors appeared, a red one, a blue one, and a green one. Opening a door cost a point, but for every room they entered, they could accrue more points. The players reacted logically. They found the most fruitful room and hold up there for the whole session. Errally and Shin then changed the rules. If doors were not opened within 12 moves, they started shrinking on the screen.
-  is not always apparent. In the financial markets, things are clear. A financial option on a security always costs something. There is no such thing as a free option. In most other realms, however, options seem to be free. But this is an illusion. They also come at a price, but the price tag is often hidden and intangible. Each decision costs mental energy and eats up precious time for thinking and living. CEOs who examine every possible expansion option often choose none in the end. Companies that aim to address all customer segments end up addressing no one.
-  But this is an illusion. They also come at a price, but the price tag is often hidden and intangible. Each decision costs mental energy and eats up precious time for thinking and living. CEOs who examine every possible expansion option often choose none in the end. Companies that aim to address all customer segments end up addressing no one. Salespeople who chase every single lead close no deals. We're obsessed with having as many irons as possible in the fire, ruling nothing out, and being open to everything. However, this can easily destroy success.
-  Close no deals. We're obsessed with having as many irons as possible in the fire, ruling nothing out and being open to everything. However, this can easily destroy success. We must learn to close doors. A business strategy is primarily a statement on what not to engage in. Adopt a life strategy similar to a corporate strategy. Write down what not to pursue in your life. In other words, make calculated decisions to disregard certain possibilities. And when an option shows up, test it against your not to pursue list. It will not only keep you from trouble, but also save you lots of thinking time.

What will your everyday life be like? With which items will you surround yourself? People who pondered this question 50 years ago had fanciful notions of how the future would look. Highways in the skies. Cities that resemble glass worlds. Bullet trains winding between gleaming skyscrapers. We would live in places that are not so far away.

People who pondered this question 50 years ago had fanciful notions of how the future would look. Highways in the skies, cities that resemble glass worlds, bullet trains winding between gleaming skyscrapers. We would live in plastic capsules, work in underground cities, vacation on the moon, and consume everything in pill form. We wouldn't conceive offspring anymore. Instead we would choose children from a catalogue. Our best friends would be robots.
-  The idea behind your leather shoes comes from the last Ice Age. Your bookshelves are made of wood, one of the oldest building materials in the world. At dinnertime you use a fork, a well-known killer app from Roman times, to shovel chunks of dead animals and plants into your mouths. Nothing has changed. How will the world look in 50 years? In his latest book, Anti-Fragile, Nassim Taleb gives us a clue. Assume that most of the technology that has existed for the past 50 years will serve us for another half century. And assume that recent technology will be passÃ© in a few years' time. Why?

Reciprocity Not so long ago, you may have come across disciples of the Hare Krishna sect floating around in saffron-colored robes as you hurried to catch a flight or a train to your destination. A member of the sect presented you with a small flower and a smile. If you're like most people, you took the flower simply to avoid seeming rude. If you tried to refuse, you would refer to gentle, take it.

-  as if they were species. Whatever has held its own throughout centuries of innovation will probably continue to do so in the future too. Old technology has proven itself. It possesses an inherent logic, even if we don't always understand it. If something has endured for epochs, it must be worth its salt. You can take this to heart the next time you're in a strategy meeting. Fifty years into the future will look a lot like today. Of course, you'll witness the birth of many flashy gadgets and magic contraptions, but most will be short-lived. When contemplating the future, we place far too much emphasis on flavor-of-the-month inventions and new ways of thinking.

Made in 1968, the movie predicted that at the turn of the millennium, the United States would have a thousand-strong colony on the moon and that Pan Am would operate the commuter flights there and back. With this fanciful forecast in mind, I suggest a rule of thumb. Whoever has survived for X years will last another X years. Tell up wagers that the bullshit filter of history will sort the gimmicks from the game changers. And that's one bet I'm willing to back.

During World War II, every nation produced propaganda movies. These were devised to fill the population, especially soldiers, with enthusiasm for the country and, if necessary, to bolster them to lay down their lives. The United States spent so much money on propaganda that the War Department decided to find out whether the expense was really worth it. A number of studies were carried out to investigate the use of propaganda.
-  During World War II, every nation produced propaganda movies. These were devised to fill the population, especially soldiers, with enthusiasm for their country, and if necessary, to bolster them to lay down their lives. The United States spent so much money on propaganda that the War Department decided to find out whether the expense was really worth it. A number of studies were carried out to investigate how the movies affected regular soldiers. The result was disappointing. They did not intensify the privates' enthusiasm for war in the slightest. Was it because they were poorly made? Hardly. Rather, the soldiers were more likely to be the victims of the war.
-  It didn't matter. Its content was deemed hollow from the outset and dismissed. Nine weeks later, something unexpected happened. The psychologists measured the soldiers' attitudes a second time. The result? Whoever had seen the movie expressed much more support for the war than those who had not viewed it. Apparently propaganda did work after all. The scientists were baffled, especially since they knew that an argument's persuasiveness decreased over time. It has a half-life like a radioactive substance. Surely you've experienced this yourself. Let's say you read an article on the benefits of gene therapy. Immediately after reading it, you're as...
-  More time passes until only a tiny fraction of enthusiasm remains. Amazingly, just the opposite is true for propaganda. If it strikes a chord with someone, this influence will only increase over time. Why? Psychologist Karl Hovland, who led the study for the War Department, named this phenomenon the sleeper effect. To date, the best explanation is that in our memories, the source of the argument fades faster than the argument. In other words, your brain quickly forgets where the information came from, such as from the Department of Propaganda. Meanwhile, the message itself, that is,
-  In the United States, elections increasingly revolve around nasty advertisements, in which candidates seek to tarnish one another's record or reputation. However, by law, each political ad must disclose its sponsor at the end, so that it is clearly distinguishable as an electioneering message. However, countless studies show that the sleeper effect does its job here, too, especially among undecided voters. The messenger fades from memory, the ugly accusations persevere. I've often wondered why advertising works at all. Any logical person must recognize ads for what they are, and suitably categorize in disquiet.
-  as a discerning and intelligent listener won't always succeed at this. It's quite possible that after a few weeks, you won't remember if you picked up certain information from a well-researched article or from a tacky advertorial. How can you thwart the sleeper effect? First, don't accept any unsolicited advice, even if it seems well-met. Doing so, you protect yourself, to a certain degree, from manipulation. Second, avoid ad-contaminated sources like the plague. How fortunate we are that books are still ad-free. Third, try to remember the source of every argument you encounter. Whose opinions are these?
-  Admittedly, this is a lot of work and will slow down your decision making, but it will also refine it. 71. Why it's never just a two-horse race. Alternative blindness. You leaf through a brochure that gushes about the benefits of the university's MBA degree. Your gaze sweeps over photos of the ivy-colored campus and the ultra-modern sports facilities. Sprinkled throughout are images of smiling students from various ethnic backgrounds, with an emphasis on young women, young Chinese, and young Indian go-getters.
-  of an MBA. The $100,000 fee is easily offset by the statistical extra income that graduates earn before they retire. $400,000 after taxes. Who wouldn't want to be up $300,000? It's a no-brainer. Wrong. Such an argument hides not one, but four fallacies. First, we have the swimmer's body illusion. MBA programs attract career-oriented people who will probably earn above-average salaries at some stage of their careers, even without the extra qualification of an MBA. The second fallacy, an MBA takes two years. During this time,
-  During this time you can expect a loss of earnings say $100,000 so in fact the MBA costs $200,000 not $100,000 That amount if invested well could easily exceed the additional income that the brochure promises Third to estimate earnings that are more than 30 years away is idiotic who knows what will happen over the next three decades Finally other alternatives exist you are not stuck between do an MBA and don't do an MBA Perhaps you can find a different program that costs significantly less and also represents a shot in the arm for your career
-  Don't do an MBA. Perhaps you can find a different program that costs significantly less and also represents a shot in the arm for your career. This fourth misconception interests me the most. Let's call it alternative blindness. We systematically forget to compare an existing offer with the next best alternative. Here's an example from the world of finance. Suppose you have a little money in your savings account and you ask your investment broker for advice. He proposes a bond that will earn you 5% interest. That's much better than the 1% you get with your savings account, he points out. Does it make sense to buy the bond?
-  we measure against the second best deal that is available at any given time, even if it means doing more of what we're already doing. Unlike Warren Buffett, politicians often fall victim to alternative blindness. Let's say your city is planning to build a sports arena on a vacant plot of land. Supporters argue that such an arena would benefit the population much more than an empty lot, both emotionally and financially. But this comparison is wrong. They should compare the construction of the sports arena with all other ideas that become impossible due to its construction. For example, building a school, a performing arts center, a hospital,
-  or an incinerator. They could also sell the land and invest the proceeds or reduce the city's debt. And you? Do you often overlook the alternatives? Let's say your doctor discovers a tumor that will kill you in five years. He proposes a complicated operation that, if successful, removes the tumor completely. However, this procedure is highly risky with a survival rate of just 50%. How do you decide? You weigh up your choices. Certain death in five years, or a 50% chance of dying next week. Alternative blindness. Perhaps there is a variant of the invasive surgery.
-  However, this procedure is highly risky with a survival rate of just 50%. How do you decide? You weigh up your choices. Certain death in five years or a 50% chance of dying next week. Alternative blindness. Perhaps there is a variant of the invasive surgery that your hospital doesn't offer, but a hospital across town does. This invasive surgery might not remove the tumor altogether, just slow its growth, but is much safer and gives you an extra 10 years. And who knows? Maybe during these 10 years a more sophisticated therapy for eradicating tumors will be made available.
-  Psychologist Robert Cialdini can explain the success of this and other such campaigns. He has studied the phenomenon of reciprocity and has established that people have extreme difficulty being in another person's debt. Many NGOs and philanthropic organizations use exactly the same techniques. First give, then take. Last week, a conservation organization sent me an envelope full of postcards featuring all sorts of idyllic landscapes. The accompanying letter assured me that the postcards were a gift to be kept, whether or not I decided to donate to their organization. Even though I understood the tactic, it took a lot of time.
-  As one of my books reached number one on the bestseller list, my publisher asked me for a favor. An acquaintance's title was on the verge of entering the top 10 list, and the publisher was convinced that a testimonial from me would give it the necessary push. It always amazes me that these little testimonials work at all. Everyone knows that only favorable comments end up on a book's jacket. The book you hold in your hands is no exception. A rational reader should ignore the praise or at least consider it alongside the criticism, which is always available, albeit in different places. Nevertheless, I've written plenty of testimonials for a good cause.
-  are gifted at overlooking the extent of their incompetence. They suffer from illusory superiority, which leads them to make even more thinking errors, thus creating a vicious cycle that erodes the talent pool over time. While his school was closed due to an outbreak of plague in 1666 to 1667, 25-year-old Isaac Newton showed his professor, Isaac Barrow, what research he was conducting in his spare time. Barrow immediately gave up his job as a professor and became a student of Newton. What a noble gesture. What ethical behavior. When was the last time you heard of a professor vacating his post in favor of Newton?
-  In the early 1960s, when the president of the United States was elected to the presidency in 1867, 25-year-old Isaac Newton showed his professor, Isaac Barrow, what research he was conducting in his spare time. Barrow immediately gave up his job as a professor and became a student of Newton. What a noble gesture. What ethical behavior. When was the last time you heard of a professor vacating his post in favor of a better job? In conclusion, do you foster individuals more talented than you? Admittedly, in the short term, the preponderance of stars can endanger your status.
-  the up-and-comers good books and learn from them. This is why I wrote the testimonial in the end. 73. Why first impressions are deceiving, primacy and recency effects. Allow me to introduce you to two men, Alan and Ben. Without thinking about it too long, decide whom you prefer. Alan is smart, hard-working, impulsive, critical, stubborn and jealous. Ben, however, is jealous, stubborn, critical, impulsive, hard-working and smart. Who would you prefer to get stuck with in an elevator?
-  This is called the primacy effect. If it were not for the primacy effect, people would refrain from decking out their headquarters with luxuriously appointed entrance halls. Your lawyer would feel happy turning up to meet you in worn out sneakers rather than beautifully polished designer oxen. The primacy effect is a very common trait in the United States. It's a very common trait. It's a very common trait. It's a very common trait. It's a very common trait. It's a very common trait. Rather than beautifully polished designer oxfords. The primacy effect triggers practical errors too. Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman describes how he used to grade examination papers at the time.
-  He did it as most teachers do, in order. Student one followed by student two and so on. This meant that students who answered the first questions flawlessly endeared themselves to him, thus affecting how he graded the remaining parts of their exams. So Kahneman switched methods and began to grade the individual questions in batches. All the answers to question one, then the answers to question two and so forth. Thus he canceled out the primacy effect. Unfortunately, this trick is not always replicable. When recruiting a new employee, for example, you run the risk of hiring the person who makes the best first impression. Ideally,
-  Unfortunately, this trick is not always replicable. When recruiting a new employee, for example, you run the risk of hiring the person who makes the best first impression. Ideally, you would set up all the candidates in order and let them answer the same question one after the other. Suppose you sit on the board of a company. A point of discussion is raised, a topic on which you have not yet passed judgment. The first opinion you hear will be crucial to your overall assessment. The same applies to the other participants, a fact that you can exploit. If you have an opinion, don't hesitate airing it first. This way, you will influence your colleagues more and draw them over to your
-  here will be crucial to your overall assessment. The same applies to the other participants, a fact that you can exploit. If you have an opinion, don't hesitate airing it first. This way you will influence your colleagues more and draw them over to your side. If, however, you're chairing the committee, always ask members' opinions in random order so that no one has an unfair advantage. The primacy effect is not always the culprit. The contrasting recency effect matters as well. The more recent the information, the better we remember it. This occurs because our short-term memory file drawer, as it were, contains very little
-  This occurs because our short-term memory file drawer, as it were, contains very little extra space. When a new piece of information gets filed, an older piece of information is discarded to make room. When does the primacy effect supersede the recency effect, or vice versa? If you have to make an immediate decision based on a series of impressions, such as characteristics, exam answers, etc., the primacy effect weighs heavier. But if the series of impressions was formed some time ago, the recency effect dominates. For instance, if you listened to a speech a few weeks ago, you'll remember the final point.
-  few weeks ago, you'll remember the final point or punchline more clearly than your first impressions. In conclusion, first and last impressions dominate, meaning the content sandwiched between has only a weak influence. Try to avoid evaluations based on first impressions. They will deceive you guaranteed in one way or another. Try to assess all aspects impartially. It's not easy, but there are ways around it. For example, in interviews I jot down a score every five minutes and calculate the average afterward. This way I make sure that the middle counts just as much as hello and goodbye.
-  even though his firm is the market leader in terms of service, security, and functionality. Most insurers are convinced that the best solution is what they have crafted themselves in-house over the past 30 years. Another CEO told me how hard it is to get his staff in the company's headquarters to accept solutions proposed from far-flung subsidiaries. When people collaborate to solve problems and then evaluate these ideas themselves, NIH syndrome will inevitably exert an influence. Thus, it makes sense to split teams into two groups. The first group generates ideas, the second rates them, and vice versa.
-  their own responses as more important and applicable than the others, even though the submissions were virtually identical. On a societal level, NIH syndrome has serious consequences. We overlook shrewd ideas simply because they come from other cultures. In Switzerland, where each state or canton has certain powers, one tiny canton never approved women's suffrage. It took a federal court ruling in 1990 to change the law, a startling case of NIH. Or consider the modern traffic roundabout, with its clear yield requirements that was designed by British transport engineers in the 1960s.

-  year out the Dow Jones rises and falls a little. Gradually you grow accustomed to this gentle up and down. Then suddenly a day like October 19th, 1987 comes around and the stock market tumbles 22% with no warning. This event is a black swan as described by Nassim Taleb in his book with the same title. A black swan is an unthinkable event that massively affects your life, your career, your company, your country. There are positive and negative black swans. The meteorite that flattens you. Sutter's discovery of gold in California. The collapse of the Soviet Union.
-  the internet browser, the overthrow of Egyptian dictator Mubarak, or another encounter that upturns your life completely. All are black swans. Think what you like of former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, but at a press conference in 2002 he expressed a philosophical thought with exceptional clarity when he offered this observation. There are things we know, known facts. There are things we do not know, known unknowns. And there are things we do not know that we do not know, unknown unknowns. How big is the universe? Does Iran have nuclear weapons? Does the internet make
-  consequential. Though we can continue to plan for the future, black swans often destroy our best laid plans. Feedback loops and nonlinear influences interact and cause unexpected results. The reason? Our brains are designed to help us hunt and gather. Back in the Stone Age we hardly ever encountered anything truly extraordinary. The deer we chased was sometimes a bit faster or slower, sometimes a little bit fatter or thinner. Everything revolved around a stable mean. Today is different. With one breakthrough you can increase your income by a factor of 10,000. Just ask Larry Page.
-  and countless species of animals would be long extinct. It's at the core of cooperation between people who are not related and a necessary ingredient for economic growth and wealth creation. There would be no global economy without it. There would be no economy at all. That's the good side of reciprocity. But there's also an ugly side of reciprocity, retaliation. Revenge breeds counter-revenge, and you soon find yourself in a full-scale war. Jesus preached that we should break this cycle by turning the other cheek, which proves very difficult to do. So compelling is the pull of reciprocity, even when the stakes are high.
-  Put yourself in situations where you can catch a ride on a positive black swan, as unlikely as that is. Become an artist, inventor, or entrepreneur with a scalable product. If you sell your time, for example as an employee, dentist, or journalist, you're waiting in vain for such a break. But even if you feel compelled to continue as such, avoid surroundings where negative black swans thrive. This means stay out of debt, invest your savings as conservatively as possible, and get used to a modest standard of living, no matter whether your big breakthrough comes or not.
-  Get used to a modest standard of living, no matter whether your big breakthrough comes or not. 76. Knowledge is non-transferable. Domain dependence. Writing books about clear thinking brings with it many pluses. Business leaders and investors invite me to give talks for good money. Incidentally, this is in itself poor judgment on their part. Books are much cheaper. At a medical conference, the following happened to me. I was speaking about base rate neglect and illustrated it with a medical example. In a 40-year-old
-  the following happened to me. I was speaking about base rate neglect and illustrated it with a medical example. In a 40 year old patient, stabbing chest pain among other things may indicate heart problems as well as stress. Stress is much more frequent with a higher base rate, so it's advisable to test the patient for this first. All this is very reasonable and the doctors understood it intuitively, but when I used an example from economics, most faltered. The same thing happens when I speak in front of investors. If I illustrate fallacies using financial examples, most catch on immediately.
-  private realm is particularly difficult to navigate. I know CEOs who are charismatic leaders in the office and hopeless duds at home. Similarly, it would be a hard task to find a more cigarette toting profession than the prophets of health themselves, the doctors. Police officers are twice as violent at home as civilians. Literary critics novels get the poorest reviews. And almost proverbially, the marriages of couples therapists are frequently more fragile than those of their clients. Mathematics professor Barry Mazur tells this story. Some years ago I was trying

Maybe you should make a list of the costs and benefits and try to roughly calculate your expected utility. Without thinking, I blurted out, come on Sandy, this is serious. What you master in one area is difficult to transfer to another. Especially daunting is the transfer from academia to real life, from the theoretically sound to the practically possible. Of course, this also counts for this book. It will be difficult to transfer.

Especially daunting is the transfer from academia to real life, from the theoretically sound to the practically possible. Of course, this also counts for this book.

Book smarts don't transfer to street smarts easily.

The Myth of Like-Mindedness False Consensus Effect Which do you prefer, music from the 60s or music from the 80s? How do you think the general public would answer this question? Most people tend to extrapolate their preferences onto others. If they love the 60s, they will automatically assume that the majority of their peers do, too. The same goes for 80 aficionados. We frequently overestimate unanimity.
-  This fallacy is called the false consensus effect. Stanford psychologist Lee Ross hit upon this in 1977. He fashioned a sandwich board emblazoned with the slogan, eat at Joe's, and asked randomly selected students to wear it around campus for 30 minutes. They also had to estimate how many other students would put themselves forward for the task. Those who declared themselves willing to wear the sign assume that the majority, 62%, would also agree to it. On the other hand, those who politely refused believed that most people, 67%, would find it too stupid to undertake. In both cases, the students imagined themselves.
-  evolution didn't eliminate it. Our brain is not built to recognize the truth. Instead, its goal is to leave behind as many offspring as possible. Whoever seemed courageous and convincing, thanks to the false consensus effect, created a positive impression, attracted a disproportionate amount of resources, and thus increased their chances of passing on their genes to future generations. Doubters were less sexy. In conclusion, assume that your worldview is not born by the public. More than that, do not assume that those who think differently are idiots. Before you distrust them, question your own assumptions.

What they recalled disclosing in 1973 was almost identical to their present-day views and a far cry from their original responses. By subconsciously adjusting past views to fit present ones, we avoid any embarrassing proof of our fallibility. It's a clever coping strategy because, no matter how tough we are, admitting mistakes is an emotionally difficult task. But this is preposterous.
-  are adamant that they would easily recognize the perpetrator again. 79. Why you identify with your football team. In-group, out-group bias. When I was a child, a typical wintery Sunday looked like this. My family sat in front of the TV watching a ski race. My parents cheered for the Swiss skiers and wanted me to do the same. I didn't understand the fuss. First, why zoom down a mountain on two planks? It makes as little sense as hopping up the mountain on one leg, while juggling three balls and stopping every hundred feet to hurl a log as far as possible.
-  Why should I identify with the Swiss skiers? Was I related to any of them? I didn't think so. I didn't even know what they thought or read. And if I lived a few feet over the Swiss border, I would probably have to cheer for another team altogether. This brings us to the question, does identifying with a group, a sports team, an ethnicity, a company, a state, represent flawed thinking? Over thousands of years, evolution has shaped every behavioral pattern, including attraction to certain groups. In times past, group membership was vital. Fending for yourself was close to impossible. As people began to form alliances...
-  refuse their offer unless you want to end up with a refrigerator full of stuff you don't even like. 7. Beware the special case. Confirmation bias part 1. Gil wants to lose weight. He selects a particular diet and checks his progress on the scale every morning. If he has lost weight, he pats himself on the back and considers the diet a success. If he has gained weight, he writes it off as a normal fluctuation and forgets about it. For months, he lives under the illusion that the diet is working even though his weight remains constant.
-  same emotions without blood relationship. Such feelings can lead to the most idiotic cognitive error of all, laying down your life for a random group, also known as going to war. It is no coincidence that motherland suggests kinship, and it's not by chance that the goal of any military training is to forge soldiers together as brothers. In conclusion, prejudice and aversion are biological responses to anything foreign. Identifying with a group has been a survival strategy for hundreds of thousands of years. Not any longer. Identifying with a group distorts your view of the facts. Should you ever be sent to war, and you don't
-  Should you ever be sent to war and you don't agree with its goals? Dessert. 80. The difference between risk and uncertainty. Ambiguity aversion. Two boxes. Box A contains 100 balls, 50 red and 50 black. Box B also holds 100 balls, but you don't know how many are red and how many are black. If you reach into one of the boxes without looking and draw out a red ball, you win $100. Which box will you choose, A or B? The majority will opt for A.
-  This time you win $100 if you draw out a black ball. Which box will you go for now? Most likely you'll choose A again. But that's illogical. In the first round you assume that B contained fewer red balls and more black balls, so rationally you would have to opt for B this time around. Don't worry, you're not alone in this error, quite the opposite. This result is known as the Ellsberg Paradox, named after Daniel Ellsberg, a former Harvard psychologist. As a side note, he later leaked the top secret Pentagon Papers to the press, leading to the downfall of President Nixon. The Ellsberg Paradox offers empirical answers to the question of how the world has changed since the first world war.

-  probabilities, box A, over unknown ones, box B. Thus we come to the topics of risk and uncertainty, or ambiguity, and the differences between them. Risk means that the probabilities are known. Uncertainty means that the probabilities are unknown. On the basis of risk, you can decide whether or not to take a gamble. In the realm of uncertainty, though, it's much harder to make decisions. The three hundred year old scientists have been doing this for over a century. The three hundred year old scientists have been doing this for over a century.

-  If he has gained weight, he writes it off as a normal fluctuation and forgets about it. For months, he lives under the illusion that the diet is working, even though his weight remains constant. Gill is a victim of the confirmation bias, albeit a harmless form of it. The confirmation bias is the mother of all misconceptions. It's the tendency to interpret new information so that it becomes compatible with our existing theories, beliefs, and convictions. In other words, we filter out any new information that contradicts our existing views, disconfirming evidence. This is a dangerous practice.
-  into risk categories, but it doesn't really fit. Let's look at two examples, one from medicine, where it works, and one from the economy, where it does not. There are billions of humans on Earth. Our bodies do not differ dramatically. We all reach a similar height. No one will ever be 100 feet tall and a similar age. No one will live for 10,000 years or for only a millisecond. Most of us have two eyes, four heart valves, 32 teeth. Another species would consider us to be homogeneous, as similar to one another as we consider mice to be. For this reason, there are many similar diseases, and it makes sense to us to be able to do that.
-  probabilities. The difference between risk and uncertainty also illustrates the difference between life insurance and credit default swaps. A credit default swap is an insurance policy against specific defaults, a particular company's inability to pay. In the first case, life insurance, we're in the calculable domain of risk. In the second, credit default swap, we're dealing with uncertainty. This confusion contributed to the chaos of the financial crisis in 2008. If you hear phrases such as, the risk of hyperinflation is X percent, or the risk to our equity position is Y, start
-  Depending on how it's built, you'll tolerate uncertainty with greater ease or difficulty. This is evident not least in your political orientation. The more averse you are to uncertainty, the more conservatively you will vote. Your political views have a partial biological underpinning. Either way, whoever hopes to think clearly must understand the difference between risk and uncertainty. Only in very few areas can we count on clear probabilities. Casinos, coin tosses, and probability textbooks often were left with troublesome ambiguity. Learn to take it in stride.
-  I found redemption. Our French house wine, RÃ©serve du Patron Bourgogne, $52. I ordered it right away. It couldn't be that bad, I reasoned. I've owned an iPhone for several years now. The gadget allows me to customize everything. Data usage, app synchronization, phone encryption, even how loud I want the camera shutter to sound. How many of these have I set up so far? You guessed it, not one. In my defense, I'm not technically challenged. Rather, I'm just another victim of the so-called default effect. The default setting is as warm and welcoming as a soft pillow.
-  need to provide a few options, always including a default choice for indecisive individuals. This is how New Jersey and Pennsylvania presented two car insurance policies to their inhabitants. The first policy was cheaper but waived certain rights to compensation should an accident take place. New Jersey advertised this as the standard option, and most people were happy to take it. In Pennsylvania, however, the second more expensive option was touted as the standard and promptly became the best seller. This outcome is quite remarkable, especially when you consider that both states' drivers cannot differ all that much in what they want covered or in what they want to pay.
-  the standard and promptly became the best seller. This outcome is quite remarkable, especially when you consider that both states' drivers cannot differ all that much in what they want covered or in what they want to pay. Or consider this experiment. There is a shortage of organ donors. Only about 40 percent of people opt for it. Scientists, Eric Johnson and Dan Goldstein, asked people whether, in the event of death, they wanted to actively opt out of organ donation. By making donation, the default option increased take-up from 40 percent to more than 80 percent of participants. A huge difference between an opt-in and an opt-out default.

The default effect is at work even when no standard option is mentioned. In such cases, we make our past the default setting.
-  annual fee of $60 for mailing out account statements. I could save myself this amount if I downloaded the statements online. However, though the pricey and paper-guzzling service has bothered me for years, I still can't bring myself to get rid of it once and for all. So where does the status quo bias come from? In addition to sheer convenience, loss aversion plays a role. Recall that losses upset us twice as much as similar gains please us. For this reason, tasks such as renegotiating existing contracts prove very difficult. Regardless of whether these are private or professional, each concession you make weighs twice as heavily.
-  Maybe it just needs a little time to develop, he said after trying the RÃ©serve du Patron. 82. Why last chances make us panic. Fear of regret. Two stories. Paul owns shares in company A. During the year, he considered selling them and buying shares in company B. In the end, he didn't. Today he knows that if he had done so, he would have been up $1,200. Second story. George had shares in company B. During the year, he sold them and bought shares in company A. Today, he also has a share in company B.
-  regret. Regret is the feeling of having made the wrong decision. You wish someone would give you a second chance. When asked who would feel worse, 8% of respondents said Paul, whereas 92% chose George. Why? Considered objectively, the situations are identical. Both Paul and George were unlucky, picked the wrong stock, and were out of pocket for the exact same amount. The only difference, Paul already possessed the shares in A, whereas George went out and bought them. Paul was passive, George active. Paul embodies the majority. Most people leave their money lying where it is for years. And George was passive.
-  The final victim is the conventional paper-only publisher. Who will regret the series of decisions most and who will gain the most sympathy? Right, the stoic e-grumbler. Here's an example from Daniel Kahneman's book, Thinking, Fast and Slow. After every plane crash, we hear the story of one unlucky person who actually wanted to fly a day earlier or later, but for some reason he changed his booking at the last minute. Since he is the exception, we feel more sympathy for him than for the other normal passengers who were booked on the ill-fated flight from the outset. The fear of regret can make us behave erratically.
-  We tend to act conservatively, so as not to deviate from the crowd too much. No one is immune to this, not even supremely self-confident traders. Statistics show that each year on December 31st, D-Day for performance reviews and bonus calculations, they tend to offload their more exotic stocks and conform to the masses. Similarly, fear of regret and the endowment effect prevent you from throwing away things you no longer require. You're afraid of the remorse you will feel in the unlikely event that you needed those worn-out tennis shoes after all.
-  If you never cared about seeing one before today, why would you fly all the way to Tanzania to do so now? It's irrational. Let's say you've long dreamed of owning a house. Land is becoming scarce. Only a handful of plots with sea views are left. Three remain, then two, and now just one. It's your last chance. This thought racing through your head, you give in and buy the last plot at an exorbitant price. The fear of regret tricked you into thinking this was a one-time offer, when in reality, real estate with a lake view will always come on the market.
-  Everywhere the executives look, they see plenty of confirming evidence. While indications to the contrary remain unseen or are quickly dismissed as exceptions or special cases, they have become blind to disconfirming evidence. What can you do? If the word exception crops up, prick up your ears. Often it hides the presence of disconfirming evidence. It pays to listen to Charles Darwin. Since his youth, he set out to fight the confirmation bias systematically. Whenever observations contradicted his theory, he took them very seriously and noted them down immediately.
-  we're assuming that the statistical relationship between marijuana and car accidents is zero. Thus, Kurt's headline is unfounded. He has fallen victim to the salience effect. Salience refers to a prominent feature, a standout attribute, a particularity, something that catches your eye. The salience effect ensures that outstanding features receive much more attention than they deserve. Since marijuana is the salient feature of this accident, Kurt believes that it's responsible for the crash. A few years later, Kurt moves into business journalism, one of the largest companies in the world.

Since his youth, he set out to fight the confirmation bias systematically. Whenever observations contradicted his theory, he took them very seriously and noted them down immediately. He knew that the brain actively forgets disconfirming evidence after a short time. The more correct he judged his theory to be, the more actively he looked for contradictions. The following experiment shows how much effort it takes to question your own theory.
-  That was the equivalent of about $250 back then, an absolute fortune for a high school student. The money spent little time in my pocket. I soon bought myself a top of the range bike with disc brakes and Shimano gears, one of the best models around. The funny thing was my old bike worked fine. Admittedly, I wasn't completely broke back then. I had managed to save up a few hundred francs through mowing grass in the neighborhood. However, it never crossed my mind to spend this hard-earned money on something so unnecessary. The most I treated myself to was a trip to the movies every now and then. It was only upon reflection that I realized how irrational my behavior had been.
-  after all, but we don't see it that way. Depending on how we get it, we treat it differently. Money is not naked. It's wrapped in an emotional shroud. Two questions. You've worked hard for a year. At the end of the 12 months, you have $20,000 more in your account than you had at the beginning. What do you do? A, leave it sitting in the bank? B, invest it? C, use it to make necessary improvements, such as renovating your moldy kitchen or replacing old tires? D, treat yourself to a luxury cruise. If you think like most people, you'll opt for A, B, or C.
-  Second question, you win $20,000 in the lottery. What do you do with it? Choose from A, B, C, or D above. Most people now take C or D. And of course, by doing so, they exhibit flawed thinking. You can count it any way you like. $20,000 is still $20,000. We witnessed similar delusions in casinos. A friend places $1,000 on the roulette table and loses everything. When asked about this, he says, I didn't really gamble away $1,000. I won all that earlier. But it's the same amount, not for me. He laughs.

We treat money that we win, discover, or inherit much more frivolously than hard-earned cash. The economist Richard Thaler calls this the house money effect. It leads us to take bigger risks. And for this reason, many lottery winners are not And for this reason, many lottery winners end up worse off after they've cashed in their winnings. That old platitude, win some, lose some, is a feeble attempt to downplay real losses.
-  students opted to risk it. The second group learned they had won nothing, but that they could choose between receiving $30 or taking part in a coin toss in which heads won them $21 and tails secured $39. The second group behaved more conservatively. Only 43% were prepared to gamble, even though the expected value for both options was the same, $30. Gambling strategists recognize the usefulness of the house money effect. Online gambling sites reward you with $100 credit when you sign up. Credit card companies offer the same when you fill in the application form.
-  The following experiment shows how much effort it takes to question your own theory. A professor presented his students with the number sequence 2-4-6. They had to calculate the underlying rule that the professor had written on the back of a sheet of paper. The students had to provide the next number in the sequence to which the professor would reply fits the rule or does not fit the rule. The students could guess as many numbers as they wanted but could try only once to identify the rule. Most students suggested 8 as the next number and the professor replied fits the rule. To be sure they tried 10, 12 and 14, the professor replied.
-  he convinces himself that there is no point starting until he is in the right mood. Unfortunately, the right mood is a rare occurrence. Another friend has tried to quit smoking every day for the past ten years. Each cigarette is his last. And me? My tax returns have been lying on my desk for six months, waiting to be completed. I haven't yet given up hope that they will fill themselves in. Procrastination is the tendency to delay unpleasant but important acts. The arduous trek to the gym. Switching to a cheaper insurance policy. Writing thank you letters. Even New Year's resolutions won't help you here.

The students could guess as many numbers as they wanted, but could try only once to identify the rule. Most students suggested eight as the next number, and the professor replied, fits the rule. To be sure, they tried ten, twelve, and fourteen. The professor replied each time, fits the rule. Then the students concluded, the rule is to add two to the last number. The professor shook his head. That is not the rule. One shrewd student tried a different approach. He tested out the next number.
-  strictly out of bounds. He then left the students alone in the room for thirty minutes. Students in a second group were allowed to eat as many cookies as they wanted. Afterward, both groups had to solve a tough math problem. The students who were forbidden to eat any cookies gave up on the math problem twice as fast as those who were allowed to gorge freely on cookies. The period of self-control had drained their mental energy, or willpower, which they now needed to solve the problem. Willpower is like a battery, at least in the short term. If it's depleted, future challenges will falter. This is a fundamental insight. Self-control
-  The next necessary condition is employing an array of tricks to keep you on the straight and narrow. This includes eliminating distractions. When I write a novel, I turn off my internet access. It's just too enticing to go online when I reach a naughty part. The most effective trick, however, is to set deadlines. Psychologist Dan Ariely found that dates stipulated by external authorities, for example, a teacher or the IRS, work best. Self-imposed deadlines will work only if the task is broken down step by step, with each part assigned its own due date. For this reason, nebulous New Year's resolutions
-  Three scenarios. Which would irk you the most? A. Your friend's salaries increase, yours stays the same. B. Their salaries stay the same, yours is too. C. Their average salaries are cut, yours is too. If you answered A, don't worry, that's perfectly normal. You're just another victim of the green-eyed monster. Here's a Russian fairy tale. A farmer finds a magic lamp. He rubs it, and out of thin air a genie appears who promises to grant him one wish. The farmer thinks about this for a little while. Finally he says,
-  Imagine your colleague scores a big bonus and you get a gift certificate. You feel envy. This creates a chain of irrational behavior. You refuse to help him any longer, sabotage his plans, perhaps even puncture the tires of his Porsche, and you secretly rejoice when he breaks his legs skiing. Of all the emotions, envy is the most idiotic. Why? Because it's relatively easy to switch off. This is in contrast to anger, sadness, or fear. Envy is the most stupid of vices, for there is no single advantage to be gained by it, writes Balzac.

Many things spark envy. Ownership, status, health, youth, talent, popularity, beauty. It's often confused with jealousy because the physical reactions are identical. The difference? The subject of envy is a thing. Status, money, health, etc. The subject of jealousy is the behavior of a third person. Envy needs two people. Jealousy on the other hand, requires three. Peter is jealous.

-  Stop comparing yourself to others. Second, find your circle of competence and fill it in on your own. Create a niche where you are the best. It doesn't matter how small your area of mastery is. The main thing is that you are king of the castle. Like all emotions, envy has its origins in our evolutionary past. If the hominid from the cave next door took a bigger share of the mammoth, it meant less for the loser. Envy motivated us to do something about it. Laissez-faire hunter-gatherers disappeared from the gene pool. In extreme cases, they died of starvation, while others feasted. We are the offspring of the envious.

-  others think and feel. Science calls this the theory of mind. Here's an experiment to illustrate it. You are given $100 and must share it with a stranger. You can decide how it's divided up. If the other person is happy with your suggestion, the money will be divided that way. If he or she turns down your offer, you must return the $100 and no one gets anything. How do you split the sum? It would make sense to offer the stranger very little, maybe just a dollar. After all, it's better than nothing. However, in the 1980s, when economists began experimenting with such ultimatum games, the technical term, the subjects

After all, it's better than nothing. However, in the 1980s, when economists began experimenting with such ultimatum games, the technical term, the subjects behaved very differently. They offered the other party between 30% and 50%. Anything below 30% was considered unfair. The ultimatum game is one of the clearest manifestations of the theory of mind. In short, we are not going to be able to solve the problem.
-  The student tried all sorts of numbers, minus 24, 9, minus 43. Apparently, he had an idea and he was trying to find a flaw with it. Only when he could no longer find a counter example, the student said, the rule is this, the next number must be higher than the previous one. The professor turned over the sheet of paper, revealing those very words. What distinguished the resourceful student from the others? While the majority of students sought merely to confirm their theories, he tried to find fault with his, consciously looking for disconfirming evidence. You might think, good for him, but not the student.

-  black t-shirts, the other white. The short clip, the monkey business illusion, is available on YouTube. Take a look before reading on. In the video, viewers are asked to count how many times the players in white t-shirts pass the ball. Both teams move in circles, weaving in and out, passing back and forth. Suddenly, in the middle of the video, something bizarre happens. A student dressed as a gorilla walks into the center of the room, pounds his chest, and promptly disappears again. At the end, you're asked if you noticed anything unusual. Half the viewers shake their heads in astonishment. Gorilla? What gorilla?
-  the video, something bizarre happens. A student dressed as a gorilla walks into the center of the room, pounds his chest, and promptly disappears again. At the end you're asked if you noticed anything unusual. Half the viewers shake their heads in astonishment. Gorilla? What gorilla? The monkey business test is considered one of the most famous experiments in psychology and demonstrates the so-called illusion of attention. We're confident that we notice everything that takes place in front of us, but in reality we often see only what we're focusing on. In this case the passes made by the team in white. Unexpected.
-  In contrast, let's define what the gorilla in the room is. A topic that is of the utmost importance and urgency, and that we absolutely need to address, but nobody knows about it. Take the case of Swiss Air, a company that was so fixated on expansion that it overlooked its evaporating liquidity and went bankrupt in 2001. Or the mismanagement in the Eastern Bloc that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Or the risks on banks' books that up until 2007 nobody paid any attention to. Such gorillas stomp around right in front of us and we barely spot them. It's not the case that we miss every single one.
-  perceive everything of importance. Purge yourself of the illusion of attention every now and then. Confront all possible and seemingly impossible scenarios. What unexpected events might happen? What lurks beside and behind the burning issues? What is no one addressing? Pay attention to silences as much as you respond to noises. Check the periphery, not just the center. Think the unthinkable. Something unusual can be huge, we still may not see it. Being big and distinctive is not enough to be seen. The unusual and huge thing must be expected.
-  petty intellectual offense. How it affects our lives will be revealed in the next chapter. 8. Murder Your Darlings. Confirmation Bias, Part 2. In the previous chapter, we met the father of all fallacies, the confirmation bias. Here are a few examples of it. We're forced to establish beliefs about the world, our lives, the economy, investments, our careers, and more. We deal mostly in assumptions, and the more nebulous these are, the stronger the confirmation bias. Whether you go through life believing that people are inherently
-  Suppose you apply for your dream job. You buff your resume to a shine. In the job interview, you highlight your achievements and abilities and gloss over weak points and setbacks. When they ask if you could boost sales by 30% while cutting costs by 30%, you reply in a calm voice, consider it done. Even though you're trembling inside and racking your brain about how the hell you're going to pull that off, you do and say whatever is necessary to get the job. You concentrate on wowing the interviewers. The details will follow. You know that if you give even semi-realistic answers, you'll put

Consider it done. Of course you don't want to lie, but you know that you won't get the advance if you tell the truth. Once the contract is signed and the money is nestling in your bank account, you can always keep the publisher at bay for a while. You're a writer. You're great at making up stories. The official term for such behavior is strategic misrepresentation. The more at stake, the more exaggerated your assertions become. Strategic misrepresentation is a form of misrepresentation.
-  In the 1980s, Consumer Reports asked experienced tasters to sample 45 different varieties of strawberry jelly. A few years later, psychology professors Timothy Wilson and Jonathan Schuller repeated the experiment with students from the University of Washington. The results were almost identical. Both students and experts preferred the same type. But that was only the first part of Wilson's experiment. He repeated it with a second group of students who, unlike the first group, had to fill in a questionnaire justifying their ratings in detail. The rankings turned out to be completely warped. Some of the best varieties ended up at the bottom of the rankings.

This raises the question, when do you listen to your head and when do you heed your gut? A rule of thumb might be, if it's something to do with practiced activities, such as motor skills, think of the centipede, van de Velde, or mastering a musical instrument, or questions you've answered a thousand times, think of Warren Buffett's circle of competence, it's better not to reflect to the less detail. It undermines your intuitive ability to solve
-  answered a thousand times, think of Warren Buffett's circle of competence, it's better not to reflect to the last detail. It undermines your intuitive ability to solve problems. The same applies to decisions that our Stone Age ancestors faced, evaluating what was edible, who would make good friends, whom to trust. For such purposes, we have heuristics, mental shortcuts that are clearly superior to rational thought. With complex matters though, such as investment decisions, sober reflection is indispensable. Evolution has not equipped us for such considerations, so logic trumps intuition.
-  The students had to specify two submission dates. The first was a realistic deadline and the second was a worst-case scenario date. The result? Only 30% of students made the realistic deadlines. On average, the students needed 50% more time than planned and a full seven days more than their worst-case scenario date. The planning fallacy is particularly evident when people work together in business, science, and politics. Groups overestimate duration and benefits and systematically underestimate costs and risks. The conch-shaped Sydney Opera House was planned in 1957.

-  for a house lands on your desk and must be discussed urgently. There goes the plan. If you plan things even more minutely, would that be a solution? No. Step-by-step preparation amplifies the planning fallacy. It narrows your focus even more and thus distracts you even more from anticipating the unexpected. So what can you do? Shift your focus from internal things, such as your own project, to external factors like similar projects. Look at the base rate and consult the past. If other ventures of the same type lasted three years and devoured five million dollars, this will probably apply to your project too.

Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's business partner, named the effect the man with the hammer tendency after Twain. But that's a perfectly disastrous way to think and a perfectly disastrous way to operate in the world. So you've got to have multiple models and the models have to come from multiple disciplines because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department. Here are a few examples of deformation
-  the man with the hammer tends to overuse it. Literary reviewers are trained to detect authors' references, symbols, and hidden messages. As a novelist, I realized that literary reviewers conjure up such devices where there are none. This is not a million miles away from what business journalists do, too. They scour the most trivial utterings of central bank governors and somehow discover hints of fiscal policy change by parsing their words. In conclusion, if you take your problem to an expert, don't expect the overall best solution. Expect an approach that can be solved with the expert's toolkit. The brain is not a central computer.

-  pocket knives are incomplete. Given our life experiences and our professional expertise, we already possess a few blades. But to better equip ourselves, we must try to add two or three additional tools to our repertoire. Mental models that are far afield from our areas of expertise. For example, over the past few years, I've begun to take a biological view of the world and have won a new understanding of complex systems. Locate your shortcomings and find suitable knowledge and methodologies to balance them. It takes about a year to internalize the most important ideas of a new field and it's worth it. Your pocket knife will be bigger.
-  finds the waiter with the incredible memory and asks him if he's seen it. He stares at her blankly. He has no idea who she is or where she's at. How can you have forgotten, she asks indignantly, especially with your super memory. The waiter replies curtly, I keep every order in my head until it's served. Zagarnick and her mentor, Kurt Lewin, studied this strange behavior and found that all people function more or less like the waiter. We seldom forget uncompleted tasks. They persist in our consciousness and do not let up, tugging at us like little children until we give them our attention. On the other hand.

They persist in our consciousness and do not let up, tugging at us like little children until we give them our attention.

-  In her investigation, she uncovered a few untidy outliers. Some people kept a completely clear head, even if they had dozens of projects on the go. Only in recent years could Roy Baumeister and his research team at Florida State University shed light on this. He took students who were a few months away from their final examinations and split them into three groups. Group one had to focus on a party during the current semester. Group two had to concentrate on the exam. Group three had to focus on the exam and also create a detailed study plan. Then Baumeister asked students to complete words under time pressure.

Group two had to concentrate on the exam. Group three had to focus on the exam and also create a detailed study plan. Then Baumeister asked students to complete words under time pressure. Some students saw PA and filled in panic while others thought of party or Paris. This was a clever method of finding out what was on each of their minds.

Although these students also had to focus on the upcoming exam, their minds were clear and free from anxiety. Further experiments confirmed this.

-  until we have a clear idea of how we'll deal with them. Zygarnik mistakenly believed that it was necessary to complete tasks to erase them from memory, but it's not a good plan of action suffices. David Allen, the author of a bestselling book aptly entitled Getting Things Done, argues that he has one goal to have a head as clear as water. For this, you don't need to have your whole life sorted into tidy compartments. But it does mean that you need a detailed plan for dealing with the messier areas. This plan must be divided into step by step tasks and preferably written down. Only when this is done can your mind rest.
-  This plan must be divided into step-by-step tasks and preferably written down. Only when this is done can your mind rest. The adjective detailed is important. Organize my wife's birthday party or find a new job are worthless. Alan forces his clients to split such projects into 20 to 50 individual tasks. It's worth noting that Alan's recommendation seems to fly in the face of the planning fallacy, Chapter 91. The more detailed our planning, the more we tend to overlook factors from the periphery that will derail our projects. But here's the rub. If you want peace of mind, go ahead.

If you want the most accurate estimate on cost, benefit, and duration of a project, forget your detailed plan and look up similar projects. If you want both, do both. Fortunately, you can do all this yourself.
-  Specifically, he calculated the correlation of the rankings between year one and year two, between year one and year three, year one and year four, up until year seven and year eight. The result? Pure coincidence. Sometimes the advisor was at the very top and sometimes the very bottom. If an advisor had a great year, this was neither bolstered by previous years nor carried into subsequent years. The correlation was zero. And yet, the consultants pocketed bonuses for their performance. In other words, the company was rewarding luck rather than skill. In conclusion, certain people make a living
-  The correlation was zero, and yet the consultants pocketed bonuses for their performance. In other words, the company was rewarding luck rather than skill. In conclusion, certain people make a living from their abilities, such as pilots, plumbers, and lawyers. In other areas, skill is necessary but not critical, as with entrepreneurs and leaders. Finally, chance is the deciding factor in a number of fields, such as in financial markets. Here, the illusion of skill pervades. So give plumbers due respect and chuckle at successful financial jesters.
-  features in each of them. Now examine Series B, 349-851-274-905-772-032-854-113. What links each of these numbers? Do not read further until you figured it out. Series B is more difficult, right? Answer, none use the number 6. What can you learn from this? Absence is much harder to detect than presence. In other words, we place greater emphasis on what's present than on what's absent. Last week, while on a walk, it occurred.
-  A classical recital and orchestra perform Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. A storm of enthusiasm gripped the concert hall. During the ode in the fourth movement, tears of joy could be seen here and there. How fortunate we are that this symphony exists, I thought. But is that really true? Would we be less happy without the work? Probably not. Had the symphony never been composed, no one would miss it. The director would receive no angry calls saying, Please have this symphony written and performed immediately. In short, what exists means a lot more than what is missing. Science calls this the feature positive effect.

In academia we constantly encounter the feature positive effect. The confirmation of hypotheses leads to publications and in exceptional cases these are rewarded with Nobel prizes.

And as far as I know, there's never been a Nobel prize awarded for this. However, such falsification is as scientifically valuable as confirmation. Another consequence of the effect is that we're also much more open to positive advice. Do X than to negative suggestions. Forget about Y. No matter how useful the latter may be.
-  In conclusion, we have problems perceiving non-events. We're blind to what does not exist. We realize if there's a war, but we don't appreciate the absence of war during peacetime. If we're healthy, we rarely think about being sick. Or if we get off the plane in Cancun, we don't stop to notice that we didn't crash. If we thought more frequently about absence, we might well be happier. But it's tough mental work. The greatest philosophical question is, why does something and not nothing exist? Don't expect a quick answer. Rather, the question itself represents a useful instrument for combating the feature positive effect.
-  cherry. Right, close to zero. To rebuff an anecdote is difficult because it's a mini story, and we know how vulnerable our brains are to those. To prevent this, cunning leaders train themselves throughout their careers to be hypersensitive to such anecdotes and to shoot them down as soon as they're uttered. The more elevated or elite a field is, the more we fall for cherry picking. In Anti-Fragile, Taleb describes how all areas of research, from philosophy to medicine to economics, brag about the results. Like politicians, academia is well equipped to tell us what it did for us, not what it did not. It
-  The Internet is particularly fertile ground for the confirmation bias. To stay informed, we browse new sites and blogs, forgetting that our favored pages mirror our existing values, be they liberal, conservative, or somewhere in between. Moreover, a lot of sites now tailor content to personal interests and browsing history, causing new and divergent opinions to vanish from the radar altogether. We inevitably land in communities of like-minded people, further reinforcing our convictions and the confirmation bias. Literary critic Arthur Quiller Couch had a memorable motto,
-  we fall for cherry picking. In Anti-Fragile, Taleb describes how all areas of research, from philosophy to medicine to economics, brag about their results. Like politicians, academia is well-equipped to tell us what it did for us, not what it did not. Hence, it shows how indispensable her methods are. Pure cherry picking. But our respect for academics is far too great for us to notice this. Or consider the medical profession, to tell people that they should not smoke is the greatest medical contribution of the past 60 years, superior to all the research and medical advances since the end of the Second World War.
-  taking the medicine. A few cherries, antibiotics for instance, distract us and so drug researchers are celebrated while anti-smoking activists are not. Administrative departments in large companies glorify themselves like hoteliers do. They're masters at showcasing all they've done but they never communicate what they haven't achieved for the company. What should you do? If you sit on the supervisory board of such an organization, ask about the leftover cherries, the failed projects and missed goals. You'll learn a lot more from this than from the successes. It's amazing how seldom such questions are asked.

-  the worldwide success of a company, the invention of writing. Any clear thinking person knows that no single factor leads to such events. Rather, there are hundreds, thousands, and infinite number of factors that add up. Still, we keep trying to pin the blame on just one. When an apple ripens and falls, what makes it fall? It's that it's attracted to the ground. It's that the stem withers. It's that the sun has dried it up. That it's grown heavier. That the wind shakes it. That the boy standing underneath it wants to eat it. No one thing is the cause. In this passage from War and Peace, Tolstoy hits the ground.

Suppose you're the product manager for a well-known breakfast cereal brand. You've just launched an organic, lower sugar variety. After a month, it's painfully clear that the new product is a flop. How do you go about investigating the cause? First, you know that there will never be one sole factor. Take a sheet of paper.

Third, conduct empirical tests by varying the highlighted factors in different markets. This costs time and money, but it's the only way to escape the swamp of superficial assumptions. The fallacy of the single cause is as ancient as it is dangerous. We've learned to see people as the masters of their own destiny.
-  their own destinies. Aristotle proclaimed this 2,500 years ago. Today we know that it's wrong. The notion of free will is up for debate. Our actions are brought about by the interaction of thousands of factors, from genetic predisposition to upbringing, from education to the concentration of hormones between individual brain cells. Still we hold firmly to the old image of self-governance. This is not only wrong but also morally questionable. As long as we believe in singular reasons, we'll always be able to trace triumphs or disasters back to individuals and stamp them responsible.
-  Literary critic Arthur Quiller Couch had a memorable motto, murder your darlings. This was his advice to writers who struggled with cutting, cherished, but redundant sentences. Quiller Couch's appeal is not just for hesitant hacks, but for all of us who suffer from the deafening silence of ascent. To fight against the confirmation bias, try writing down your beliefs, whether in terms of worldview, investments, marriage, health care, diet, career strategies, and set out to find disconfirming evidence. Axing beliefs that feel like old friends is hard work, but imperative.
-  beach is around 75 miles. Drivers who cover the distance in an hour or less will categorize as reckless drivers because they're traveling at an average of 75 miles per hour or more. All others we put into the group of careful drivers. Which group experiences fewer accidents? Without a doubt it's the reckless drivers. They all completed the journey in less than an hour so they couldn't have been involved in any accidents. This automatically puts all drivers who end up in accidents in the slower drivers category. This example illustrates a treacherous fallacy, the so-called intention to treat error. Unfortunately there is no catchier term for it.
-  vehemently insisted that every company should borrow at will, and of course, his bank is the best place to do it. I examined the study more closely. How could that be? Indeed, from 1,000 randomly selected firms, those with large loans displayed higher returns not only on their equity, but also on their total capital. They were in every respect more successful than the independently financed firms. Then the penny dropped. Unprofitable companies don't get corporate loans. Thus, they form part of the equity-only group. The other firms that make up this set have bigger cash cushions, stay afloat longer, and no matter how sickly they are, they are not going to be able to pay their loans.
-  Okay, got it. Watch out. The intention to treat error is not easy to recognize. A fictional example from medicine. A pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug to fight heart disease. A study proves that it significantly reduces patients' mortality rates. The data speaks for itself. Among patients who have taken the drug regularly, the five-year mortality rate is 15 percent. For those who have swallowed placebo pills, it's about the same, indicating that the pill doesn't work. However, and this is crucial, the mortality rate of patients who have taken the drug at irregular intervals is 30 percent, twice as high.
-  who have taken the drug at irregular intervals is 30%, twice as high. A big difference between regular and irregular intake. So the pill is a complete success. Or is it? Here's the snag. The pill is probably not the decisive factor. Rather, it's the patient's behavior. Perhaps patients discontinued the pill following severe side effects and thus landed in the irregular intake category. Maybe they were so ill that there was no way to continue it on a regular basis. Either way, only relatively healthy patients remain in the regular group, which makes the drug look a lot more effective than it really is.
-  patients discontinued the pill following severe side effects and thus landed in the irregular intake category. Maybe they were so ill that there was no way to continue it on a regular basis. Either way, only relatively healthy patients remain in the regular group, which makes the drug look a lot more effective than it really is. The really sick patients, who for this very reason couldn't take the drug on a regular basis, ended up populating the irregular intake group. In reputable studies, medical researchers evaluate the data of all patients whom they originally intend to treat, hence the title. It doesn't matter if they take part in the trial or they drop out.

-  Earthquake in Sumatra, plane crash in Russia, man holds daughter captive in cellar for 30 years, Heidi Klum separates from seal, record salaries at Bank of America, attack in Pakistan, resignation of Mali's president, new world record in shot put. Do you really need to know all these things? We are incredibly well informed, yet we know incredibly little. Why? Because two centuries ago we invented a toxic form of knowledge called news. News is to the mind what sugar is to the body, appetizing, easy to digest, and highly destructive in the long run.
-  Axing beliefs that feel like old friends is hard work, but imperative. 9. Don't bow to authority. Authority bias The first book of the Bible explains what happens when we disobey a great authority. We get ejected from paradise. This is also what less celestial authorities would have us believe. Appundance, scientists, doctors, CEOs, economists, government heads, sports commentators, consultants, and stock market gurus. Authorities pose two main problems to clear thinking.
-  friends and acquaintances, work as a news filter and keeps me in the loop. A dozen reasons exist to give news a wide berth. Here are the top three. First, our brains react disproportionately to different types of information. Scandalous, shocking, people-based, loud, fast-changing details all stimulate us, whereas abstract, complex, and unprocessed information sedates us. News producers capitalize on this. Gripping stories, garish images, and sensational facts capture our attention. Recall for a moment their business models. Advertisers buy space and thus finance it.
-  Gripping stories, garish images, and sensational facts capture our attention. Recall for a moment their business models. Advertisers buy space and thus finance the news circus on the condition that their ads will be seen. The result? Everything subtle, complex, abstract, and profound must be systematically filtered out, even though such stories are much more relevant to our lives and to our understanding of the world. As a result of news consumption, we walk around with a distorted mental map of the risks and threats we actually face. Second, news is irrelevant. In the past 12 months, you've probably consumed about

As a result of news consumption, we walk around with a distorted mental map of the risks and threats we actually face. Second, news is irrelevant. In the past 12 months, you've probably consumed about 10,000 news snippets, perhaps as many as 30 per day. Be very honest. Name one of them, just one that helped you make a better decision for your life, your career, or your business, compared with not having this piece of news. No one I know
-  Be very honest. Name one of them. Just one that helped you make a better decision for your life, your career, or your business, compared with not having this piece of news. No one, I have asked, has been able to name more than two useful news stories out of 10,000. A miserable result. News organizations assert that their information gives you a competitive advantage. Too many fall for this. In reality, news consumption represents a competitive disadvantage. If news really helped people advance, journalists would be at the top of the income pyramid. They aren't. Quite the opposite.

In reality, news consumption represents a competitive disadvantage. If news really helped people advance, journalists would be at the top of the income pyramid. They aren't. Quite the opposite. Third, news is a waste of time. An average human being squanders half a day each week on reading about current affairs. In global terms, this is an immense loss of productivity. Take the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai. Out of sheer thirst for recognition, terrorists
-  Terrorists murdered 200 people. Let's say a billion people devoured an hour of their time to following the aftermath. They viewed the minute-by-minute updates and listened to the inane chatter of a few experts and commentators. This is a very realistic guesstimate since India has more than a billion inhabitants. Thus, our conservative calculation? One billion people multiplied by an hour's distraction equals one billion hours of work stoppage. If we convert this, we learn that news consumption wasted around 2,000 lives. Ten times more than the attack. A sarcastic but accurate observation. I would predict that
-  Thus, our conservative calculation? One billion people multiplied by an hour's distraction equals one billion hours of work stoppage. If we convert this, we learn that news consumption wasted around 2,000 lives. Ten times more than the attack. A sarcastic but accurate observation. I would predict that turning your back on news will benefit you as much as purging any of the other 98 flaws we've covered in the pages of this book. Kick the habit. Completely. Instead, read long background articles and books. Yes, nothing beats books for understanding the world.
-  The Pope asked Michelangelo, tell me the secret of your genius. How have you created the statue of David, the masterpiece of all masterpieces? Michelangelo's answer, it's simple. I removed everything that is not David. Let's be honest. We don't know for sure what makes us successful. We can't pinpoint exactly what makes us happy. But we know with certainty what destroys success or happiness. This realization, as simple as it is, is fundamental. Negative knowledge, what not to do, is much more potent than positive knowledge, what to do.

-  I've listed almost 100 thinking errors in this book without answering the question, what are thinking errors anyway? What is irrationality? Why do we fall into these traps? Two theories of irrationality exist, a hot and a cold. The hot theory is as old as the hills. Here is Plato's analogy. A rider steers wildly galloping horses. The rider signifies reason and the galloping horses embody emotions. Reason tames feelings. If this fails, irrationality runs free. Another example, feelings are like bubbling lava. Usually reason can keep a little bit of water in the water.
-  Galloping horses embody emotions. Reason tames feelings. If this fails, irrationality runs free. Another example, feelings are like bubbling lava. Usually reason can keep a lid on them, but every now and then the lava of irrationality erupts, hence hot irrationality. There's no reason to fret about logic. It's error-free. It's just that sometimes emotions overpower it. This hot theory of irrationality boiled and bubbled for centuries. For John Calvin, the founder of a strict form of Protestantism in the 1500s, such feelings represented evil, and only by focusing on the
-  The result was a cold theory of irrationality that states, thinking is in itself not pure, but prone to error. This affects everyone. Even highly intelligent people fall into the same cognitive traps. Likewise, errors are not randomly distributed. We systematically err in the same direction. That makes our mistakes predictable and thus fixable to a degree, but only to a degree, never completely. For a few decades, the origins of these errors remained in the dark. Everything else in our body is relatively reliable. Heart, muscles, lungs, immune system.
-  Thinking is a biological phenomenon. Evolution has shaped it just as it has the forms of animals or the colors of flowers. Suppose we could go back 50,000 years, grab hold of an ancestor, and bring him back with us into the present. We send him to the hairdresser and put him in a Hugo Boss suit. Would he stand out on the street? No. Of course he would have to learn English, how to drive, and how to operate a cell phone, but we had to learn those things too. Biology has dispelled all doubt. Physically, and that includes cognitively, we are hunter-gatherers in Hugo Boss. Or H&M, as the case may be.

Physically, and that includes cognitively, we are hunter-gatherers in Hugo Boss, or H&M as the case may be. What has changed markedly since ancient times is the environment in which we live. Back then, things were simple and stable. We lived in small groups of about 50 people. There was no significant technological or social progress. Only in the last 10,000 years, we have been able to live in a society where we are able to do what we want. We have been able to live in a society where we are able to do what we want.

-  or H&M as the case may be. What has changed markedly since ancient times is the environment in which we live. Back then things were simple and stable. We lived in small groups of about 50 people. There was no significant technological or social progress. Only in the last 10,000 years did the world begin to transform dramatically with the development of crops, livestock, villages, cities, global trade and financial markets. Since industrialization little is left of the environment for which our brain is optimized. If you spend 15 minutes in a shopping mall you'll pass more people than our ancestors saw during the last century.
-  Whoever claims to know how the world will look in 10 years is made into a laughing stock less than a year after such a pronouncement. In the past 10,000 years, we've created a world that we no longer understand. Everything is more sophisticated, but also more complex and interdependent. The result is overwhelming material prosperity, but also lifestyle diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, lung cancer and depression, and errors in thinking. If the complexity continues to rise, and it will, that much is certain. These errors will only increase and intensify. In our hunter-gatherer past, we have seen the world change.
-  If your hunter-gatherer buddies suddenly bolted, it made sense to follow suit, regardless of whether a saber-toothed tiger or a boar had startled them. If you failed to run away and it turned out to be a tiger, the price of first-degree error was death. On the other hand, if you had just fled from a boar, this lesser mistake would have cost you only a few calories. It paid to be wrong about the same things. Whoever was wired differently exited the gene pool after the first or second incidents. We are the descendants of those hominÃ©s sapientes who tend to flee when the crowd does.
-  Perhaps every candy bar in a brown wrapper must be a Hershey bar. Even intelligent people are susceptible to this flawed conclusion. So are native tribes that for the most part remain untouched by civilization. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors were certainly not impervious to faulty logic. Some bugs in our thinking are hardwired and have nothing to do with the mutation of our environment. Why is that? Evolution doesn't optimize us completely. As long as we advance beyond our competitors, namely beat the Neanderthals, we can get away with error-laced behavior. Consider the cuckoo. For hundreds of thousands of years, they have laid the groundwork for the evolution of our environment.
-  For hundreds of thousands of years, they have laid their eggs in the nests of songbirds, which then incubate and even feed the cuckoo chicks. This represents a behavioral error that evolution has not erased from the smaller birds. It's not deemed to be serious enough. A second parallel explanation of why our mistakes are so persistent took shape in the late 1990s. Our brains are designed to reproduce rather than search for the truth. In other words, we use our thoughts primarily to persuade. Whoever convinces others secures power and thus access to resources. Such assets represent a major advantage for mating and for rearing offspring.
-  In other words, we use our thoughts primarily to persuade. Whoever convinces others secures power and thus access to resources. Such assets represent a major advantage for mating and for rearing offspring. The truth is, at best, a secondary focus and is reflected in the book market. Novels sell much better than non-fiction titles in spite of the latter's superior candor. Finally, a third explanation exists. Intuitive decisions, even if they lack logic, are better under certain circumstances. So-called heuristic research deals with this topic. For many decisions, we lack the ability to make decisions.
-  Finally, a third explanation exists. Intuitive decisions, even if they lack logic, are better under certain circumstances. So-called heuristic research deals with this topic. For many decisions, we lack the necessary information. So we're forced to use mental shortcuts and rules of thumb, heuristics. If you're drawn to different potential romantic partners, you must evaluate whom to marry. This is not a rational decision. If you rely solely on logic, you'll remain single forever. In short, we often decide intuitively and justify our choices later. Many decisions, career, life partner,

If you rely solely on logic, you'll remain single forever. In short, we often decide intuitively and justify our choices later. Many decisions, career, life partner, investments, take place subconsciously. A fraction of a second later, we construct a reason so that we feel we made a conscious choice. Alas, we don't behave like scientists who are purely interested in objective facts.
-  choice. Alas, we don't behave like scientists who are purely interested in objective facts. Instead, we think like lawyers, crafting the best possible justification for a predetermined conclusion. So forget about the left and right brain that semi-intelligent self-help books describe. Much more important is the difference between intuitive and rational thinking. Both have legitimate applications. The intuitive mind is swift, spontaneous, and energy-saving. Rational thinking is slow, demanding, and energy-guzzling, in the form of blood sugar. Nobody has the ability to do so.
-  Much more important is the difference between intuitive and rational thinking. Both have legitimate applications. The intuitive mind is swift, spontaneous, and energy-saving. Rational thinking is slow, demanding, and energy-guzzling, in the form of blood sugar. Nobody has described this better than the great Daniel Kahneman in Thinking Fast and Slow. Since I started to collect cognitive errors, people often ask me how I manage to live an error-free life. The answer is, I don't. In fact, I don't even try. Just like everybody else, I make snap decisions by consulting not my thoughts, but my feelings.
-  I have set myself the following rules in situations where the possible consequences are large Namely important personal or business decisions. I try to be as reasonable and rational as possible when choosing I take out my list of errors and check them off one by one just like a pilot does I've created a handy checklist decision tree and I use it to examine important decisions with a fine-tooth comb In situations where the consequences are small namely regular or diet Pepsi Sparkling or flat water. I forget about rational optimization and let my intuition take over Thinking is tiring therefore if the potential harm is small
-  I've created a handy checklist decision tree, and I use it to examine important decisions with a fine-tooth comb. In situations where the consequences are small, namely regular or diet Pepsi, sparkling or flat water, I forget about rational optimization and let my intuition take over. Thinking is tiring. Therefore, if the potential harm is small, don't rack your brains. Such errors won't do lasting damage. You'll live better like this. Nature doesn't seem to mind if our decisions are perfect or not, as long as we can maneuver ourselves through life, and as long as we're ready to be rational when it comes to the crunch.
-  If your arm is small, don't rack your brains. Such errors won't do lasting damage. You'll live better like this. Nature doesn't seem to mind if our decisions are perfect or not, as long as we can maneuver ourselves through life, and as long as we're ready to be rational when it comes to the crunch. And there's one other area where I let my intuition take the lead, when I'm in my circle of competence. If you practice an instrument, you learn the notes and tell your fingers how to play them. Over time, you know the keys or the strings inside out. You see a musical score, and your hands play the notes almost automatically. Warren Buffett reads balance sheets all the time.

-  In reality, no electrical current was actually flowing. Milgram used an actor to play the role of the victim. But those charged with administering the shocks didn't know that. The results were, well, shocking. As the person in the other room wailed and writhed in pain, and the subject administering the shock wanted to stop, the professor would say, keep going, the experiment depends on it. The majority of people continued with the electrocution. More than half of the participants went all the way up to the maximum voltage, out of sheer obedience to authority.
-  the dangers of the authority bias. In the old days, the captain was king. His commands were not to be doubted. If a co-pilot suspected an oversight, he wouldn't have dared to address it out of respect for, or fear of, his captain. Since this behavior was discovered, nearly every airline has instituted Crew Resource Management, CRM, which coaches pilots and their crews to discuss any reservations they have openly and quickly. In other words, they carefully deprogram the authority bias. CRM has contributed more to flight safety in the past 20 years than have any technical advances.
-  where employees are likely to keep their lesser opinions to themselves, much to the detriment of the business. Authorities crave recognition and constantly find ways to reinforce their status. Doctors and researchers sport white coats. Bank directors don suits and ties. Kings wear crowns. Members of the military wield rank badges. Today, even more symbols and props are used to signal expertise. Appearances on talk shows and on the covers of magazines, to book tours and Wikipedia entries. Authority changes, much like fashion does, and society follows it just as it does.

In conclusion, when you're about to make a decision, think about which authority figures might be exerting an influence on your reasoning. And when you encounter one in the flesh, do your best to challenge him or her.

Contrast Effect In his book Influence, Robert Cialdini tells the story of two brothers, Sid and Harry, who ran a clothing store in 1930s America. Sid was in charge of sales and Harry led the tailoring department. Whenever Sid noticed that the customers who stood before the mirror really liked their suits, he became a little hard of hearing. He called to his brother, Harry, how much for this suit? Harry looked up from his computer.
-  Take two buckets, fill the first with lukewarm water and the second with ice water. Dip your right hand into the ice water for one minute. Then put both hands into the lukewarm water. What do you notice? The lukewarm water feels as it should to the left hand and piping hot to the right hand. Both of these stories epitomize the contrast effect. We judge something to be beautiful, expensive, or large if we have something ugly, cheap, or small in front of us. We have difficulty with absolute judgments. The contrast effect is a common misconception. You order leather seats for your new car because compared to the old one,
-  ice water for one minute, then put both hands into the lukewarm water. What do you notice? The lukewarm water feels as it should to the left hand and piping hot to the right hand. Both of these stories epitomize the contrast effect. We judge something to be beautiful, expensive or large if we have something ugly, cheap or small in front of us.

-  do the $60,000 price tag on the car, $3,000 seems a pittance. All industries that offer upgrade options exploit this illusion. The contrast effect is at work in other places, too. Experiments show that people are willing to walk an extra 10 minutes to save $10 on food. But those same people wouldn't dream of walking 10 minutes to save $10 on a $1,000 suit. And a rational move, because 10 minutes is 10 minutes, and $10 is $10. Logically, you should walk back in both cases, or not at all. Without the contrast effect, the discount business would be completely untenable. A product
-  investor told me the share is a great value because it's 50% below the peak price. I shook my head. A share price is never low or high it is what it is and the only thing that matters is whether it goes up or down from that point. When we encounter contrasts we react like birds to a gunshot. We jump up and get moving. Our weak spot we don't notice small gradual changes. A magician can make your watch vanish because when he presses on one part of your body you don't notice the lighter touch on your wrist as he relieves you of your Rolex. Similarly we fail to notice how our money disappears.
-  attractive than you really are. Go alone, or better yet, take two ugly friends. 11, why we prefer a wrong map to none at all. Availability bias. Smoking can't be that bad for you. My grandfather smoked three packs of cigarettes a day and lived to be more than 100. Or Manhattan is really safe. I know someone who lives in the middle of the village and never locks his door, not even when he goes on vacation. And his apartment has never been broken into. We use statements like these to try to prove something, but they actually prove.
-  and he never locks his door, not even when he goes on vacation, and his apartment has never been broken into. We use statements like these to try to prove something, but they actually prove nothing at all. When we speak like this, we succumb to the availability bias. Are there more English words that start with a K or more words with K as its third letter? Answer. More than twice as many English words have K in the third position than start with a K. Why do most people believe the opposite is true? Because we can think of words beginning with a K more quickly. They're more available to our memory.
-  beginning with a K, more quickly. They're more available to our memory. The availability bias says this. We create a picture of the world using the examples that most easily come to mind. This is idiotic, of course, because in reality things don't happen more frequently just because we can conceive of them more easily. Thanks to the availability bias, we travel through life with an incorrect risk map in our heads. Thus, we systematically overestimate the risk of being the victims of a plane crash, a car accident or a murder. And we underestimate the risk of dying from less spectacular means, such as diabetes or stomach cancer.
-  The availability bias has an established seat at the corporate board's table, too. Board members discuss what management has submitted, usually quarterly figures, instead of more important things such as a clever move by the competition, a slump in employee motivation, or an unexpected change in customer behavior. They tend not to discuss what's not on the agenda. In addition, people prefer information that's easy to obtain, be it economic data or recipes. They make decisions based on this information, rather than on more relevant but harder to obtain information, often with disastrous results.
-  or recipes. They make decisions based on this information rather than on more relevant but harder to obtain information, often with disastrous results. For example, we've known for 10 years that the so-called black shoeless formula for the pricing of derivative financial products does not work, but we don't have another solution, so we carry on with an incorrect tool. It's as if you were in a foreign city without a map and then pulled out one for your hometown and simply use that. We prefer wrong information to no information. Thus, the availability bias has presented the banks with billions in losses.
-  in a foreign city without a map and then pulled out one for your hometown and simply use that. We prefer wrong information to no information. Thus, the availability bias has presented the banks with billions in losses. What was it that Frank Sinatra sang? Something about loving the girl I'm near when I'm not near the girl I love? A perfect example of the availability bias. End it off by spending time with people who think differently than you do. People whose experiences and expertise are different from yours. We require others' input to overcome the availability bias.

A few years ago I was on vacation in Corsica and fell sick. The symptoms were new to me and the pain was growing by the day. Eventually I decided to seek help at a local clinic. A young doctor began to inspect me, prodding my stomach, gripping my shoulders and knees, and then poking each vertebra. I began to suspect that he had no idea what my problem was.
-  A young doctor began to inspect me, prodding my stomach, gripping my shoulders and knees, and then poking each vertebra. I began to suspect that he had no idea what my problem was, but I wasn't really sure, so I simply endured the strange examination. To signal its end, he pulled out his notebook and said, antibiotics, take one tablet three times a day, it'll get worse before it gets better. Glad that I now had a treatment, I dragged myself back to my hotel room with the prescription in my hand. The pain grew worse and worse, just as the doctor had predicted. The doctor must have known what was wrong with me after all. But
-  the prescription in my hand. The pain grew worse and worse, just as the doctor had predicted. The doctor must have known what was wrong with me after all. But when the pain hadn't subsided after three days, I called him. Increase the dose to five times a day. It's going to hurt for a while more, he said. After two more days of agony, I finally called the International Air Ambulance. The Swiss doctor diagnosed appendicitis and operated on me immediately. Why did you wait so long? He asked me after the surgery. I replied, it all happened exactly as the doctor said, so I trusted him.
-  without a trace. In his desperation, he hires a consultant. For $5,000 a day, this man analyzes the company and comes back with his findings. Your sales department has no vision, and your brand isn't positioned clearly. It's a tricky situation. I can fix it for you, but not overnight. The measures will require sensitivity, and most likely sales will fall further before things improve. The CEO hires the consultant. A year later, sales fall, and the same thing happens the next year. Again and again, the consultant stresses that the company's progress corresponds closely to his prediction. As
-  but not overnight. The measures will require sensitivity, and most likely sales will fall further before things improve. The CEO hires the consultant. A year later, sales fall, and the same thing happens the next year. Again and again, the consultant stresses that the company's progress corresponds closely to his prediction. As sales continue their slump in the third year, the CEO fires the consultant. A mere smoke screen, the it'll get worse before it gets better fallacy, is a variant of the so-called confirmation bias. If the problem continues to worsen, the prediction is confirmed.
-  strategy success is the religious zealot who believes that before we can experience heaven on earth the world must be destroyed. Disasters, floods, fires, death, they're all part of the larger plan and must take place. These believers will view any deterioration of the situation as confirmation of the prophecy and any improvement as a gift from God. In conclusion, if someone says it'll get worse before it gets better, you should hear alarm bells ringing. But beware, situations do exist where things first dip, then improve. For example, a career change requires time and often incorporates loss of pay.
-  deterioration of the situation as confirmation of the prophecy and any improvement as a gift from God. In conclusion, if someone says it'll get worse before it gets better, you should hear alarm bells ringing. But beware, situations do exist where things first dip then improve. For example, a career change requires time and often incorporates loss of pay. The reorganization of a business also takes time. But in all these cases, we can see relatively quickly if the measures are working. The milestones are clear and verifiable. Look to these rather than to the heavens.
-  The milestones are clear and verifiable. Look to these rather than to the heavens. 13. Even true stories are fairy tales. Story Bias Life is a muddle, as intricate as a Gordian knot. Imagine an invisible Martian decides to follow you around with an equally invisible notebook, recording what you do, think, and dream. The rundown of your life would consist of entries such as drank coffee, two sugars, stepped on a thumbtack and swore like a sailor, dreamed that I kissed the neighbor, booked a
-  loose monetary policy created the collapse of Lehman Brothers. We comprehend why the Iron Curtain had to fall, or why Harry Potter became a best seller. Here we speak about understanding. But these things cannot be understood in the traditional sense. We simply build the meaning into them afterward. Stories are dubious entities. They simplify and distort reality and filter things that don't fit. But apparently, we can't do without them. Why remains unclear. What is clear is that people first use stories to explain the world before they began to think scientifically, making mythology older than philosophy.
-  inevitably leads us to take bigger risks and urges us to take a stroll on thin ice. 14, why you should keep a diary, hindsight bias. I came across the diaries of my great uncle recently. In 1932, he emigrated from a tiny Swiss village to Paris to seek his fortune in the movie industry. In August 1940, two months after Paris was occupied, he noted,
-  occupied, he noted, everyone is certain that the Germans will leave by the end of the year. Their officers also confirmed this to me. England will fall as fast as France did, and then we'll finally have our Parisian lives back, albeit as part of Germany. The occupation lasted four years. In today's history books, the German occupation of France seems to form part of a clear military strategy. In retrospect, the actual course of the war appears the most likely of all scenarios. Why? Because we have fallen victim to the hindsight bias. Let's take a more recent example. In 2007, economic experts
-  In retrospect, the actual course of the war appears the most likely of all scenarios. Why? Because we have fallen victim to the hindsight bias. Let's take a more recent example. In 2007, economic experts painted a rosy picture for the coming years. However, just 12 months later, the financial markets imploded. Asked about the crisis, the same experts enumerated its causes. In hindsight, the reasons for the crash seem painfully obvious.
-  One particularly blundering example, nowadays it seems tragic yet completely plausible that a single shot in Sarajevo in 1914 would totally upturn the world for 30 years and cost 50 million lives. Every child learns this historical detail in school, but back then nobody would have dreamed of such an escalation. It would have sounded too absurd. So why is the hindsight bias so perilous? Well, it makes us believe we're better predictors than we actually are, causing us to be arrogant about our knowledge and consequently to take too much risk and not just with global issues.
-  just so similar, or they spent too much time together, or even they barely saw one another. Overcoming the hindsight bias isn't easy. Studies have shown that people who are aware of it fall for it just as much as everyone else. So, I'm very sorry, but you've just wasted your time reading this chapter. If you're still with me, I have one final tip, this time from personal rather than professional experience. Type a journal. Write down your predictions. For political changes, your career, your weight, the stock market, and so on. Then, from time to time, compare your notes with actual developments. You'll be amazed.
-  developments. You'll be amazed at what a poor forecaster you are. Don't forget to read history too. Not the retrospective compacted theories compiled in textbooks, but the diaries, oral histories, and historical documents from the period. If you can't live without news, read newspapers from 5, 10, or 20 years ago. This will give you a much better sense of just how unpredictable the world is. Hindsight may provide temporary comfort to those overwhelmed by complexity, but as for providing deeper revelations about how the world works, you'll benefit by looking elsewhere.
-  the world works, you'll benefit by looking elsewhere. 15. Why you systematically overestimate your knowledge and abilities. Overconfidence Effect My favorite musician, Johann Sebastian Bach, was anything but a one-hit wonder. He composed numerous works. How many there were, I'll reveal at the end of this chapter. But for now, here's a small assignment. How many concertos do you think Bach composed? Choose a range, for example between 100 and 500, aiming for an estimate that is 98% correct and only 2% correct.
-  phenomenon, the overconfidence effect. The overconfidence effect also applies to forecasts such as stock market performance over a year or your firm's profits over three years. We systematically overestimate our knowledge and our ability to predict on a massive scale. The overconfidence effect does not deal with whether single estimates are correct or not, rather it measures the difference between what people really know and what they think they know. What surprising is this, experts suffer even more from the overconfidence effect than laypeople do. If asked to forecast oil prices in five years time,
-  by the optimistic figures, and through their activities, politicians get more votes. We'll examine this strategic misrepresentation, Chapter 89, later in the book. What makes the overconfidence effect so prevalent and its effects so confounding is that it's not driven by incentives. It's raw and innate. And it's not counterbalanced by the opposite effect, underconfidence, which doesn't exist. No surprise to some readers, the overconfidence effect is more pronounced in men. Women tend not to overestimate their knowledge and abilities as much. Even more troubling, optimists are not the only victims of the overconfidence effect.
-  confidence effect is more pronounced in men. Women tend not to overestimate their knowledge and abilities as much. Even more troubling, optimists are not the only victims of the overconfidence effect. Even self-proclaimed pessimists overrate themselves. Just less extremely. In conclusion, be aware that you tend to overestimate your knowledge. Be skeptical of predictions, especially if they come from so-called experts. And with all plans, favor the pessimistic scenario. This way you have a chance of judging the situation somewhat realistically. Back to the question from the beginning. Johann Sebastian
-  He may have composed considerably more, but they're lost. 16. Don't take news anchors seriously. Chauffeur Knowledge After receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918, Max Planck went on tour across Germany. Wherever he was invited, he delivered the same lecture on new quantum mechanics. Over time, his chauffeur grew to know it by heart. It has to be boring giving the same speech each time, Professor Planck. How about I do it for you in Munich? You can sit in the front row and wear my chauffeur's cap.
-  which is obviously not the case. To guard against the chauffeur effect, Warren Buffett, Munger's business partner, has coined a wonderful phrase, the circle of competence. What lies inside this circle you understand intuitively. What lies outside you may only partially comprehend. One of Munger's best pieces of advice is, you have to stick within what I call your circle of competence. You have to know what you understand and what you don't understand. It's not terribly important how big the circle is, but it is terribly important that you know where the perimeter is. Munger underscores this. So you have to fit in.
-  that you can make. You have to figure out where you've got an edge, and you've got to play within your own circle of competence. In conclusion, be on the lookout for chauffeur knowledge. Don't confuse the company spokesperson, the ringmaster, the newscaster, the schmoozer, the verbiage vendor, or the clichÃ© generator with those who possess true knowledge. How do you recognize the difference? There's a clear indicator. True experts recognize the limits of what they know and what they do not know. If they find themselves outside their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, I don't know.
-  even with a certain pride. From chauffeurs, we hear every line except this. 17. You control less than you think. Illusion of control. Every day, shortly before nine o'clock, a man with a red hat stands in a square and begins to wave his cap around wildly. After five minutes, he disappears. One day, a policeman comes up to him and asks, What are you doing? I'm keeping the giraffes away. But there aren't any giraffes here. Well, I must be doing a good job then. A friend with a broken
-  and as gingerly as possible if they're hoping for a low number, which is as nonsensical as football fans thinking they can swing a game by gesticulating in front of the TV. Unfortunately, they share this illusion with many people who also seek to influence the world by sending out the right thoughts, such as vibrations, positive energy, karma. The illusion of control is the tendency to believe that we can influence something over which we have absolutely no sway. This was discovered in 1965 by two researchers, Jenkins and Ward. Their experiment was simple, consisting of just two switches and a light.
-  positive energy, karma. The illusion of control is the tendency to believe that we can influence something over which we have absolutely no sway. This was discovered in 1965 by two researchers, Jenkins and Ward. Their experiment was simple, consisting of just two switches and a light. The men were able to adjust when the switches connected to the light and when not. Even when the light flashed on and off at random, subjects were still convinced that they could influence it by flicking the switches. Or consider this example. An American researcher has been investigating acoustic sensitivity to pain. For this,
-  the gym. The rock stars are everywhere. There are lots of them. And they are successful. Motivated by the stories of countless guitar heroes, Rick starts a band. Will he make it big? The probability lies a fraction above zero. Like so many others, he will most likely end up in the graveyard of failed musicians. This burial ground houses 10,000 times more musicians than the stage does. But no journalist is interested in failures, with the exception of fallen superstars. This makes the cemetery invisible to outsiders. In daily life,
-  encouraged these prisoners not to give up hope. Crossing the street in Los Angeles is a tricky business but luckily at the press of a button we can stop traffic or can we? The buttons real purpose is to make us believe we have an influence on the traffic lights and thus we're better able to endure the wait for the signal to change with more patience. The same goes for door open and door close buttons and elevators. Many are not even connected to the electrical panel. Such tricks are also designed in open plan offices. For some people it will always be too hot for others too cold. Clever technicians create
-  little of tangible value into the real economy. They're merely sound waves. And still we allow economic heads to continue to play with the illusory dials. It would be a real wake-up call if all involved realized the truth, that the world economy is a fundamentally uncontrollable system. And you? Do you have everything under control? Probably less than you think. Don't think you command your way through life like a Roman emperor. Rather, you're the man with the red hat. Therefore, focus on the few things of importance that you can really influence. For everything else, que sera sera.
-  To control a rat infestation, French colonial rulers in Hanoi in the 19th century passed a law. For every dead rat handed into the authorities, the catcher would receive a reward. Yes, many rats were destroyed, but many were also bred specially for this purpose. In 1947, when the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, archaeologists set a finder's fee for each new parchment. Instead of lots of extra scrolls being found, they were simply torn apart to increase the reward. Similarly, in China in the 19th century, an incentive was offered for finding diamonds.
-  Like so many others, he will most likely end up in the graveyard of failed musicians. This burial ground houses 10,000 times more musicians than the stage does, but no journalist is interested in failures, with the exception of fallen superstars. This makes the cemetery invisible to outsiders. In daily life, because triumph is made more visible than failure, you systematically overestimate your chances of succeeding. As an outsider, you, like Rick, succumb to an illusion, and you mistake how miniscule the probability of success really is.
-  all the benefits that came with it. It was win-win. Imagine for a moment that instead of demanding enemies' riches, warriors and soldiers charged by the hour, we'd effectively be incentivizing them to take as long as possible, right? So why do we do just this with lawyers, architects, consultants, accountants, and driving instructors? My advice? Forget hourly rates and always negotiate a fixed price in advance. Be wary, too, of investment advisors endorsing particular financial products. They're not interested in your financial well-being, but in earning a commission on these products. The same goes for entrepreneurs.
-  What makes up the remaining 10%? Passion, idiocy, psychosis, or malice. 19. The dubious efficacy of doctors, consultants, and psychotherapists. Regression to mean. His back pain was sometimes better, sometimes worse. There were days when he felt like he could move mountains, and those when he could barely move. If that was the case, fortunately it happened only rarely, his wife would drive him to the chiropractor. The next day he felt much more mobile, and recommended the therapist to everyone.
-  their personal norms even without the training. The situation is similar with patients who are hospitalized for depression. They usually leave the clinic feeling a little better. It's quite possible, however, that the stay contributed absolutely nothing. Another example, in Boston, the lowest performing schools were entered into a complex support program. The following year, the schools had moved up in the rankings, an improvement that the authorities attributed to the program rather than to natural regression to mean. Ignoring regression to mean can have destructive consequences, such as teachers or managers concluding that the stick is bad.
-  stick is better than the carrot. For example, following a test, the highest performing students are praised and the lowest are castigated. In the next exam, other students will probably, purely coincidentally, achieve the highest and lowest scores. Thus, the teacher concludes that reproach helps and praise hinders, a fallacy that keeps on giving. In conclusion, when you hear stories such as, I was sick, went to the doctor, and got a few days later, or, the company had a bad year, so we got a consultant in, and now the results are back to normal. Look out for our old friend, the regression to mean error.
-  Sultan in and now the results are back to normal. Look out for our old friend, the regression to mean error. 20, never judge a decision by its outcome. Outcome bias. A quick hypothesis. Say 1 million monkeys speculate on the stock market. They buy and sell stocks like crazy, and of course, completely at random. What happens? After one week, about half of the monkeys will have made a profit, and the other half a loss. The ones that made a profit can stay, the ones that made a loss, you send home.
-  will have made a profit and the other half a loss. The ones that made a profit can stay, the ones that made a loss you send home. In the second week, one half of the monkeys will still be riding high, while the other half will have made a loss and are sent home. And so on. After ten weeks, about one thousand monkeys will be left, those who have always invested their money well. After twenty weeks, just one monkey will remain. This one always, without fail, chose the right stocks and is now a billionaire. Let's call him the success monkey. How does the media react? It will pounce on this animal to understand its success principles.
-  and so on. After 10 weeks, about 1,000 monkeys will be left, those who have always invested their money well. After 20 weeks, just one monkey will remain. This one always, without fail, chose the right stocks and is now a billionaire. Let's call him the success monkey. How does the media react? It will pounce on this animal to understand its success principles, and they will find some. Perhaps the monkey eats more bananas than others. Perhaps he sits in another corner of the cage, or maybe he swings headlong through the branches, or he takes long reflective pauses while grooming. He must have some recipe for success.
-  Perhaps the monkey eats more bananas than others. Perhaps he sits in another corner of the cage. Or maybe he swings headlong through the branches. Or he takes long reflective pauses while grooming. He must have some recipe for success, right? How else could he perform so brilliantly? Spot on for two years, and that from a simple monkey? Impossible. The monkey story illustrates the outcome bias. We tend to evaluate decisions based on the result rather than on the decision process. This fallacy is also known as the historian error. A classic example is the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Should the military base have been evacuated or not?
-  known as the historian error. A classic example is the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Should the military base have been evacuated or not? From today's perspective, obviously, for there was plenty of evidence that an attack was imminent. However, only in retrospect do the signals appear so clear. At the time, in 1941, there was a plethora of contradictory signals. Some pointed to an attack, others did not. To assess the quality of the decision, we must use the information available at the time, filtering out everything we know about it post-attack, particularly that it did indeed take place. Another experiment.
-  There's a 33% chance that no one will die, a 41% chance that one person will die, and a 20% chance that two people will die. That's a simple probability calculation. What stands out, there is no huge difference between zero dead and two dead. To assess the three surgeons purely on the basis of the outcomes would be not only negligent, but also unethical. In conclusion, never judge a decision purely by its result, especially when randomness and external factors play a role. A bad result does not automatically indicate a bad decision, and vice versa. So rather than tearing your hair off,

In conclusion, never judge a decision purely by its result, especially when randomness and external factors play a role. A bad result does not automatically indicate a bad decision and vice versa. So rather than tearing your hair out about a wrong decision or applauding yourself for one that may have only coincidentally led to success, remember why you chose what you did. Were your reasons rational and understandable? Then you would do well to stick with that method even if you didn't strike it lucky last time.

Less is More Paradox of Choice My sister and her husband bought an unfinished house a little while ago. Since then, we haven't been able to talk about anything else. The sole topic of conversation for the past two months has been bathroom tiles, ceramic, granite, marble, metal, stone, wood, glass, and every type of laminate known to man. Rarely have I seen my sister in such anguish.
-  but there is a limit. When it succeeded, a surfeit of choices destroys quality of life. The technical term for this is the paradox of choice. In his book of the same title, psychologist Barry Schwartz describes why this is so. First, a large selection needs to enter paralysis. To test this, a supermarket set up a stand where customers could sample 24 varieties of jelly. They could try as many as they liked and then buy them at a discount. The next day, the owners carried out the same experiment with only six flavors. The result? They sold ten times more jelly on day two. Why? Why?
-  To test this, a supermarket set up a stand where customers could sample 24 varieties of jelly. They could try as many as they liked and then buy them at a discount. The next day, the owners carried out the same experiment with only six flavors. The result? They sold ten times more jelly on day two. Why? With such a wide range, customers couldn't come to a decision, so they bought nothing. The experiment was repeated several times with different products. The results were always the same. Second, a broader selection leads to poorer decisions. If you ask young people what's important in a life partner, they reel off all the usual qualities.
-  selection process you already know, perhaps even from personal experience. Finally, large selection leads to discontent. How can you be sure you're making the right choice when 200 options surround and confound you? The answer is you cannot. The more choice you have, the more unsure and therefore dissatisfied you are afterward. So what can you do? Think carefully about what you want before you inspect existing offers. Write down these criteria and stick to them rigidly. Also realize that you can never make a perfect decision. Aiming for this is, given the flood of possibilities, a form of irrational precision.
-  you are afterward. So what can you do? Think carefully about what you want before you inspect existing offers. Write down these criteria and stick to them rigidly. Also realize that you can never make a perfect decision. Aiming for this is, given the flood of possibilities, a form of irrational perfectionism. Instead, learn to love a good choice. Yes, even in terms of life partners. Only the best will do. In this age of unlimited variety, rather the opposite is true. Good enough is the new optimum. Except of course for you and me.
-  Rather the opposite is true. Good enough is the new optimum Except of course for you and me 22 you like me you really really like me liking bias Kevin has just bought two boxes of fine Margot He rarely drinks wine not even Bordeaux, but the sales assistant was so nice not fake or pushy Just really likeable so he bought them Joe Gerard is considered the most successful car salesman in the world his tip for success There's nothing more effective than selling anything
-  the most successful car salesman in the world. His tip for success? There's nothing more effective in selling anything than getting the customer to believe, really believe, that you like him and care about him. Gerard doesn't just talk the talk. His secret weapon is sending a card to his customers each month. Just one sentence salutes them. I like you. The liking bias is startlingly simple to understand, and yet we continually fall prey to it. It means this, the more we like someone, the more inclined we are to buy from or help that person. Still, the question remains, what does likable even mean?
-  seem unfriendly and don't even make it into the background. C, A. In addition to engaging super attractive types, advertising also employs people like you and me. C, B. Those who are similar in appearance, accent, or background. In short, the more similar, the better. Mirroring is a standard technique in sales to get exactly this effect. Here the salesperson tries to copy the gestures, language, and facial expressions of his prospective client. If the buyer speaks very slowly and quietly, often scratching his head, it makes sense for the seller to speak slowly and quietly and to scratch his head now and then too. That makes him
-  the seller to speak slowly and quietly and to scratch his head now and then too. That makes him likeable in the eyes of the buyer, and thus a business deal is more likely. Finally, it's not unheard of for advertisers to pay us compliments. How many times have you bought something because you're worth it? Here factor C comes into play. We find people appealing if they like us. Compliments work wonders even if they ring hollow as a drum. So-called multi-level marketing, selling through personal networks, works solely because of the liking bias. Though there are excellent plastic containers in the supermarket for a quarter of the price, Tupperware generally is the best.
-  Bribery, I inquired. He shook his head. We were chatting and suddenly we got onto the topic of sailing. It turned out that both of us, the buyer and me, were die hard 470 dinghy fans. From that moment on, he liked me. I was a friend. So the deal was sealed. Amiability works better than bribery. So if you're a salesperson, make buyers think you like them, even if this means outright flattery. Even if you're a consumer, always judge a product independent of who is selling it. Banish the salespeople from your mind, or rather, pretend you don't like them.

Although it had a few miles on the odometer, it looked in perfect condition. I know a little about used cars, and to me it was worth around $40,000. However, the salesman was pushing for $50,000 and wouldn't budge a dime. When he called the next week to say he would accept $40,000 after all, I went for it.
-  I proceeded to offer me $53,000 in cash on the spot. I politely declined. Only on the way home did I realize how ridiculous I was to have said no. Something that I considered worth $40,000 had passed into my possession and suddenly taken on a value of more than $53,000. If I were thinking purely rationally, I would have sold the car immediately. But alas, I'd fallen under the influence of the endowment effect. We consider things to be more valuable the moment we own them. In other words, if we're selling something, we charge more for it than what we ourselves would be willing to spend. To probe this,
-  attached to their houses and thus systematically overestimate their value. They balk at the market price expecting buyers to pay more which is completely absurd since this excess is little more than sentimental value. Richard Thaler performed an interesting classroom experiment at Cornell University to measure the endowment effect. He distributed coffee mugs to half of the students and told them they could either take the mug home or sell it at a price they could specify. The other half of the students who didn't get a mug were asked how much they would be willing to pay for a mug. In other words Thaler set up a market for coffee mugs. One would expect that roughly fifty percent

The other half of the students who didn't get a mug were asked how much they would be willing to pay for a mug. In other words, Thaler set up a market for coffee mugs. One would expect that roughly 50% of the students would be willing to trade, to either sell or buy a mug. But the result was much lower than that. Why? The average owner would not sell below $5.25 and the average buyer would not pay more than $2.25 for a mug. We can safely say that we're better at collecting things than at casting them off.
-  buyer would not pay more than $2.25 for a mug. We can safely say that we're better at collecting things than at casting them off. Not only does this explain why we fill our homes with junk, but also why lovers of stamps, watches, and pieces of art part with them so seldomly. Amazingly, the endowment effect affects not only possession, but also near ownership. Auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's thrive on this. A person who bids until the end of an auction gets the feeling that the object is practically theirs, thus increasing its value. The would-be owner is suddenly willing to pay much more than planned.
-  I'll offer more insight on the winner's curse in chapter 35. There's a similar effect in the job market. If you're applying for a job and don't get a callback, you have every reason to be disappointed. However, if you make it to the final stages of the selection process and then receive the rejection, the disappointment can be much bigger, irrationally. Either you get the job or you don't. Nothing else should matter. In conclusion, don't cling to things. Enter your property something that the universe, whatever you believe this to be, has bestowed to you temporarily. Keep in mind that it can recoup this or more in the blink of an eye.
-  temporarily. Keep in mind that it can recoup this or more in the blink of an eye. 24. The Inevitability of Unlikely Events Coincidence At 7.15 p.m. on March 1, 1950, the 15 members of the church choir in Beatrice, Nebraska, were scheduled to meet for a rehearsal. For various reasons, they were all running late. The minister's family was delayed because his wife still had to iron their daughter's dress. One couple was held back when their car wouldn't start. The piano
-  One couple was held back when their car wouldn't start. The pianist wanted to be there 30 minutes early, but he fell into a deep sleep after dinner. And so on. At 7.25 p.m., the church exploded. The blast was heard all around the village. It blew out the walls and sent the roof crashing to the ground. Miraculously, nobody was killed. The fire chief traced the explosion back to a gas leak, even though members of the choir were convinced they had received a sign from God. Hand of God or coincidence? Something last week made me think of a good news.
-  Something last week made me think of my old school friend, Andy, whom I hadn't spoken to in a long time. Suddenly the phone rang. I picked it up and, lo and behold, it was Andy. I must be telepathic, I exclaimed excitedly. But telepathy or coincidence? On October 5, 1990, the San Francisco Examiner reported that Intel would take its rival, AMD, to court. Intel found out that the company was planning to launch a computer chip named AM386, a term that clearly referred to Intel's 386 chip. How Intel came upon the information is remarkable.
-  rehearsals and their churches don't blow up. Suddenly the story has lost its unimaginable quality. For all these millions of churches, it would be improbable if something like what happened in Beatrice, Nebraska didn't take place at least once a century. So no hand of God. And anyway, why would God want to blow a church to smithereens? Let's apply the same thinking to the phone call. Keep in mind the many occasions when Andy thinks of you but doesn't call. When you think of him and he doesn't call. When you don't think of him and he calls. When he doesn't think of you and you call.
-  It's not surprising when they finally happen. What would be more surprising is if they never came to be 25 the calamity of conformity group think Have you ever bitten your tongue in a meeting surely you sit there say nothing and not along to proposals After all you don't want to be the eternal naysayer Moreover you might not be 100% sure why you disagree Whereas the others are unanimous and far from stupid so you keep your mouth shut for another day When everyone thinks and acts like this
-  percent sure why you disagree, whereas the others are unanimous and far from stupid. So you keep your mouth shut for another day. When everyone thinks and acts like this, groupthink is at work. This is where a group of smart people makes reckless decisions because everyone aligns their opinions with the supposed consensus. Thus, motions are passed that each individual group member would have rejected if no peer pressure had been involved. Groupthink is a special branch of social proof, a flaw that we discussed in Chapter 4. In March 1960, the U.S. Secret Service began to mobilize anti-communist
-  no peer pressure had been involved. Groupthink is a special branch of social proof, a flaw that we discussed in Chapter 4. In March 1960, the U.S. Secret Service began to mobilize anti-communist exiles from Cuba, most of them living in Miami, to use against Fidel Castro's regime. In January 1961, two days after taking office, President Kennedy was informed about the secret plan to invade Cuba. Three months later, a key meeting took place at the White House where Kennedy and his advisors all voted in favor of the invasion. On April 17, 1961, a brigade of about 1,400

In January 1961, two days after taking office, President Kennedy was informed about the secret plan to invade Cuba. Three months later, a key meeting took place at the White House where Kennedy and his advisors all voted in favor of the invasion. On April 17, 1961, a brigade of about 1,400 exiled Cubans landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south coast with the help of the U.S. Navy, the Air Force, and the CIA. The aim was to overthrow Castro's government. However, nothing went as planned.
-  1,800 exiled Cubans landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south coast with the help of the US Navy the Air Force and the CIA the aim was to overthrow Castro's government However, nothing went as planned on the first day Not a single supply ship reached the coast The Cuban Air Force sank the first two and the next two turned around and fled back to the United States a day later Castro's army completely surrounded the brigade on the third day the 1,200 survivors were taken into custody and sent to military prisons Kennedy's invasion of the Bay of Pigs is regarded as one of the biggest flops in American foreign policy
-  The 1200 survivors were taken into custody and sent to military prisons. Kennedy's invasion of the Bay of pigs is regarded as one of the biggest flops in American foreign policy that such an absurd plan was ever agreed upon. Nevermind put into action is astounding. All of the assumptions that spoke in favor of the invasion were erroneous. For example, Kennedy's team completely underestimated the strength of Cuba's air force. Also, it was expected that in an emergency, the brigade would be able to hide in the Escambray Mountains and carry out an underground war against Castro from there. A glance at the map shows that the refuge was 100 miles

A glance at the map shows that the refuge was 100 miles away from the Bay of Pigs, with an insurmountable swamp in between. And yet, Kennedy and his advisors were among the most intelligent people to ever run an American government. What went wrong between January and April 1961? Psychology professor Irving Janis has studied many fiascos. He concluded that they share the following pattern. Members of a close-knit group
-  Psychology professor Irving Janus has studied many fiascos. He concluded that they share the following pattern. Members of a close-knit group cultivate team spirit by unconsciously building illusions. One of these fantasies is a belief in invincibility. If both our leader, in this case Kennedy, and the group are confident that the plan will work, then luck will be on our side. Next comes the illusion of unanimity. If the others are of the same opinion, any dissenting view must be wrong. No one wants to be the naysayer that destroys team unity. Finally, each person is happy to be part of the team.

Hence our strong urge to remain in the group's favor. Groupthink is no secret.
-  in the business world. A classic example is the fate of the world-class airline, Swissair. Here, a group of highly paid consultants rallied around the former CEO and, bolstered by the euphoria of past successes, they developed a high-risk expansion strategy, including the acquisition of several European airlines. The zealous team built up such a strong consensus that even rational reservations were suppressed, leading to the airline's collapse in 2001. If you ever find yourself in a tight, unanimous group, you must speak your mind, even if your team doesn't like it. Question tacit assumptions even

Two games of chance. In the first, you can win $10 million, and in the second, $10,000. Which do you play? If you win the first game, it changes your life completely. You can quit your job, tell your boss where to go, and live off the winnings. If you hit the jackpot in the second game, you can take a nice vacation in the Caribbean, but you'll be back at your house.
-  jackpots, mega millions, mega billions, mega trillions, no matter how small the odds are. In a classic experiment from 1972, participants were divided into two groups. The members of the first group were told that they would receive a small electric shock. In the second group, subjects were told that the risk of this happening was only 50%. The researchers measured physical anxiety, heart rate, nervousness, sweating, etc., shortly before commencing. The results were, well, shocking. There was absolutely no difference. Participants in both groups were equally stressed.

The researchers measured physical anxiety, heart rate, nervousness, sweating, etc., shortly before commencing. The results were, well, shocking. There was absolutely no difference. Participants in both groups were equally stressed. Next, the researchers announced a series of reductions in the probability of a shock for the second group, from 50% to 20%, then 10%, then 5%. The result? Still no difference. However, when they declared that they would increase the probability of a shock, they were told that the risk of this happening was only 50%. The researchers announced a series of reductions in the probability of a shock for the second group, from 50% to 20%, then 10%, then 5%. The results? Still no difference. However, when they declared that they would increase the probability of a shock for the third group, from 50% to 20%, then 10%, then 5%, the result? Still no difference.

Next, the researchers announced a series of reductions in the probability of a shock for the second group, from 50% to 20%, then 10%, then 5%. The result? Still no difference. However, when they declared that they would increase the strength of the expected current, both groups' anxiety levels rose. Again, by the same degree. This illustrates that we respond to the expected magnitude of an event, the size of the jackpot, or the amount of electricity.
-  group, from 50% to 20%, then 10%, then 5%. The result? Still no difference. However, when they declared that they would increase the strength of the expected current, both groups' anxiety levels rose, again by the same degree. This illustrates that we respond to the expected magnitude of an event, the size of the jackpot or the amount of electricity, but not to its likelihood. In other words, we lack an intuitive grasp of probability. The proper term for this is neglect of probability, and it leads to errors in decision making. We invest in startups because of their lack of probability.
-  Google shares with a return of 20% must be twice as good as property that returns 10%. That's wrong. It would be a lot smarter to also consider both investments risks. But then again, we have no natural feel for this, so we often turn a blind eye to it. Back to the experiment with the electric shocks. In Group B, the probability of getting a jolt was further reduced from 5% to 4% to 3%, only when the probability reached zero did Group B respond differently than Group A. To us, 0% risk seems infinitely better than a highly improbable 1% risk.
-  1% risk. To test this, let's examine two methods of treating drinking water. Suppose a river has two equally large tributaries. One is treated using method A, which reduces the risk of dying from contaminated water from 5% to 2%. The other is treated using method B, which reduces the risk from 1% to 0%. That is, the threat is completely eliminated. So method A or B? If you think like most people, you'll opt for method B, which is silly because with measure A, 3% fewer people die, and with B, just 1% fewer. Method A is three times as good.
-  one percent fewer. Method A is three times as good. This fallacy is called the zero risk bias. A classic example of this is the US Food Act of 1958, which prohibits food that contains cancer causing substances. Instituted to achieve zero risk of cancer, this ban sounds good at first, but it ended up leading to the use of more dangerous but non-carcinogenic food additives. It's also absurd. As Paracelsus illustrated in the 16th century, poisoning is always a question of dosage. Furthermore, this law can never be enforced properly since it's impossible to remove the last
-  good at first, but it ended up leading to the use of more dangerous but non-carcinogenic food additives. It's also absurd. As Paracelsus illustrated in the 16th century, poisoning is always a question of dosage. Furthermore, this law can never be enforced properly since it's impossible to remove the last banned molecule from food. Each farm would have to function like a hyper sterile computer chip factory and the cost of food would increase a hundredfold. Economically, zero risk rarely makes sense. One exception is when the consequences are colossal, such as a deadly highly contagious virus escaping from a biotech laboratory.
-  a hundredfold. Economically, zero risk rarely makes sense. One exception is when the consequences are colossal, such as a deadly, highly contagious virus escaping from a biotech laboratory. We have no intuitive grasp of risk, and thus distinguish poorly among different threats. The more serious the threat, and the more emotional the topic, such as radioactivity, the less reassuring a reduction in risk seems to us. Two researchers at the University of Chicago have shown that people are equally afraid of a 99% chance, as they are of a 1% chance of contamination by toxic chemicals.
-  a 1% chance of contamination by toxic chemicals. An irrational response, but a common one. 27, why the last cookie in the jar makes your mouth water? Scarcity error. Coffee at a friend's house. We sat trying to make conversation while her three children grappled with one another on the floor. Suddenly I remembered that I had brought some glass marbles with me, a whole bag full. I spilled them out on the floor in the hope that the little angels would play with them in peace. Far from it. A heated argument ensued. I didn't understand what was happening until
-  promising projects, investments, and careers. It's a sad walk, but one that should clear your mind. 2. Does Harvard Make You Smarter? Swimmers' Body Illusion As essayist and trader Nassim Taleb resolved to do something about the stubborn extra pounds he'd been carrying, he contemplated taking up various sports. However, joggers seemed scrawny and unhappy, and bodybuilders looked broad and stupid, and tennis players? Oh, so upper middle class. Swimmers, though, appealed to him with their way of thinking.
-  email service, I was dead set on getting an account. In the end, I did. At the time, new accounts were very restricted and were given out only by invitation. This made me want one even more. But why? Certainly not because I needed another email account. Back then, I already had four. Nor because Gmail was better than the competition. But simply because not everyone had access to it. Looking back, I have to laugh at how childish adults are. Rara sunt cara, said the Romans. Rare is valuable. In fact, the scarcity error is as old as mankind. My friend with the three children is a part-time realtor.

Whenever she has an interested buyer who cannot decide, she calls and says, ï¿½A doctor from London saw the plot of land yesterday. He liked it a lot. What about you? Are you still interested?ï¿½ The doctor from London, sometimes itï¿½s a professor or a banker, is of course fictitious. The effect is very real, though. It causes prospects to see the opportunity disappearing before their eyes, so they act and close the deal. Why? This is the potential shortage of supply, yet again. Objectively, is incomprehensible. Either the prospect wants the

The first group received an entire box of cookies and the second group just two. In the end, the subjects with just two cookies rated the quality much higher than the first group did. The experiment was repeated several times and always showed the same result. Meanwhile stocks last, the ads alert. Today only, warn the posters. Gallery owners take advantage of the scarcity error by placing red sold dots under most of their paintings, transforming the remaining few works into rare items.
-  no practical purpose. The post office doesn't accept the old stamps, the banks don't take old coins, and the vintage cars are no longer allowed on the road. These are all side issues. The attraction is that they're in short supply. In one study, students were asked to arrange ten posters in order of attractiveness, with the agreement that afterward they could keep one poster as a reward for their participation. Five minutes later, they were told that the poster with the third highest rating was no longer available. Then they were asked to judge all ten from scratch. The poster that was no longer available was suddenly classified as the most beautiful.

When we're deprived of an option, we suddenly deem it more attractive. It's a kind of act of defiance. It's also known as the Romeo and Juliet effect.
-  Romeo and Juliet effect. Because the love between the tragic Shakespearean teenagers is forbidden, it knows no bounds. This yearning must not necessarily be in a romantic way. In the United States, student parties are often littered with desperately drunk teenagers. In Europe, where the age limit is 18, you don't witness this type of behavior. In conclusion, the typical response to scarcity is a lapse in clear thinking. They purchase products and services solely on the basis of their price and benefits. It should be of no importance if an item is disappearing fast or if any doctors from London take an interest.
-  It should be of no importance if an item is disappearing fast or if any doctors from London take an interest. 28. When you hear hoofbeats, don't expect a zebra. Base rate neglect. Mark is a thin man from Germany with glasses who likes to listen to Mozart. Which is more likely, that A. Mark is a truck driver or B. He is a professor of literature in Frankfurt. Most will bet on B, which is wrong. Germany has 10,000 times more truck drivers than Frankfurt has literature professors.
-  B, he is a professor of literature in Frankfurt. Most will bet on B, which is wrong. Germany has 10,000 times more truck drivers than Frankfurt has literature professors. Therefore, it's more likely that Mark is a truck driver. So what just happened? The detailed description enticed us to overlook the statistical reality. Scientists call this fallacy base rate neglect, a disregard of fundamental distribution levels. It's one of the most common errors in reasoning. Virtually all journalists, economists, and politicians fall for it on a regular basis. Here's a second example.
-  Now, option B is much more likely because there are a million times more middle class Americans than there are Russian knife importers. In medicine, base rate neglect plays an important role. For example, migraines can point, among others, to a viral infection or a brain tumor. However, viral infections are much more common. In other words, they have a higher base rate. So doctors assess patients for these first before testing for tumors. This is very reasonable. In medical school, residents spend a lot of time purging base rate neglect. The motto drummed into any prospective doctor in the United States is, When you hear hoofbeats behind you,
-  However, viral infections are much more common. In other words, they have a higher base rate. So doctors assess patients for these first before testing for tumors. This is very reasonable. In medical school, residents spend a lot of time purging base rate neglect. The motto drummed into any prospective doctor in the United States is, when you hear hoof beats behind you, don't expect to see a zebra, which means investigate the most likely ailments before you start diagnosing exotic diseases, even if you're a specialist in that. Doctors are the only professionals who enjoy this base rate training. Regrettably, few people in business

In the summer of 1913 something incredible happened in Monte Carlo. Crowds gathered around a roulette table and could not believe their eyes. The ball had landed on black 20 times in a row. Many players took advantage of the opportunity and immediately put their money on red. But the ball continued to come to rest on black.
-  A ball cannot remember how many times it has landed on black. Despite this, one of my friends entered the weekly Mega Millions numbers into a spreadsheet and then plays those that have appeared the least. All this work is for naught. He is another victim of the gambler's fallacy. The following joke illustrates this phenomenon. A mathematician is afraid of flying due to the small risk of a terrorist attack, so on every flight he takes a bomb with him in his hand luggage. The probability of having a bomb on the plane is very low, he reasons, and the probability of having two bombs on the same plane is virtually zero. A coin is flipped three times and lands on black.
-  mean. An example, if you're experiencing record cold where you live, it's likely that the temperature will return to normal values over the next few days. If the weather functioned like a casino, there would be a 50% chance that the temperature would rise and a 50% chance that it would drop. But the weather isn't like a casino. Complex feedback mechanisms in the atmosphere ensure that extremes balance themselves out. In other cases, however, extremes intensify. For example, the rich tend to get richer. A stock that shoots up creates its own demand to a certain extent simply because it stands out so much. A sort of reverse compensation effect.

So take a closer look at the independent and interdependent events around you. Purely independent events really only exist at the casino, in the lottery, and in theory. In real life, in the financial markets, and in business, with the weather and your health, events are often interrelated. What has already happened has an influence on what will happen.

If you don't know the year off the top of your head and your smartphone battery has just died, how do you answer this? Perhaps you know that he was president during the Civil War in the 1860s and that he was a member of the United States in the 1860s and that he was the first U.S. president to be assassinated. Looking at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, you don't see a young, energetic man, but something more akin to a worn-out, sick, and tired man.
-  Let's assume that he was assassinated in the mid-1860s, making 1805 our estimate for the year he was born. The correct answer is 1809. So how did we work it out? We found an anchor to help us, the year 1865, and worked from there to an educated guess. Whenever we have to guess something, the length of the Mississippi River, population density in Russia, the number of nuclear power plants in France, we use anchors. We start with something we're sure of and venture into unfamiliar territory from there. How else could we do it? Just pick a number off the top of our heads? That would be irrational.
-  As with the swimmers' bodies, beauty is a factor for selection and not the result. Whenever we confuse selection factors with results, we fall prey to what Taleb calls the swimmers' body illusion. Without this illusion, half of advertising campaigns would not work. But this bias has to do with more than just the pursuit of chiseled cheekbones and chests. For example, Harvard has the reputation of being a top university. Many highly successful people have studied there. Does this mean that Harvard is a good school? We don't know. Perhaps the school is terrible and it simply recruits the best of the best.
-  We start with something we're sure of and venture into unfamiliar territory from there. How else could we do it? Just pick a number off the top of our heads? That would be irrational. Unfortunately, we also use anchors when we don't need to. For example, one day in a lecture, a professor placed a bottle of wine on the table. He asked his students to write down the last two digits of their social security numbers and then decide if they would be willing to spend that amount on the wine. In the auction that followed, students with higher numbers bid nearly twice as much as students with lower numbers. The social security digits worked as an anchor, albeit in a hidden and misleading way.

In the auction that followed, students with higher numbers bid nearly twice as much as students with lower numbers. The Social Security digits worked as an anchor, albeit in a hidden and misleading way. The psychologist Amos Tversky conducted an experiment involving a wheel of fortune. He had participants spin it and afterward they were asked how many member states the United Nations has. Their guesses confirmed the anchor effect. The highest estimates came from people who had spun high numbers on the wheel. Researchers Russo and Schumer
-  experiment involving a wheel of fortune. He had participants spin it, and afterward they were asked how many member states the United Nations has. Their guesses confirmed the anchor effect. The highest estimates came from people who had spun high numbers on the wheel. Researchers Russo and Shoemaker also asked students in what year Attila the Hun suffered his crushing defeat in Europe. Just like the example with Social Security numbers, the numbers were anchored, this time with the last few digits of their telephone number. The result? People with higher numbers chose later years, and vice versa. If you were wondering, Attila's demise came about in 453.
-  they were informed about a randomly generated listed sales price. As might be expected, the anchor influenced the students. The higher this price, the higher they valued the property. And the professionals, did they value the house objectively? No, they were similarly influenced by the random anchor amount. The more uncertain the value of something, such as real estate, company stock, or art, the more susceptible even experts are to anchors. Anchors abound, and we all clutch to them. The recommended retail price printed on many products is nothing more than an anchor. Sales professionals know they must
-  random anchor amount. The more uncertain the value of something, such as real estate, company stock, or art, the more susceptible even experts are to anchors. Anchors abound, and we all clutch to them. The recommended retail price printed on many products is nothing more than an anchor. Sales professionals know they must establish a price at an early stage, long before they have an offer. Also, it's been proven that if teachers know students' past grades, it influences how they'll mark new work. The most recent grades act as a starting point. In my early years, I had a quick stint at a consulting firm. My boss was a pro when it came to marketing.
-  past grades, it influences how they'll mark new work. The most recent grades act as a starting point. In my early years, I had a quick stint at a consulting firm. My boss was a pro when it came to using anchors. In his first conversation with any client, he made sure to fix an opening price, which, by the way, almost criminally exceeded our internal costs. I'll tell you this now so you're not surprised when you receive the quote, Mr. So-and-so. You've just completed a similar project for one of your competitors, and it was in the range of $5 million. The anchor was dropped. The price negotiation started at exactly $5 million.

At first the shy animal is hesitant, wondering, what's going on here? Why is he feeding me? This continues for a few more weeks until eventually the goose's skepticism gives way. After a few months, the goose is sure. The farmer has my best interests at heart. Each additional day's feeding confirms this.
-  After a few months, the goose is sure. The farmer has my best interests at heart. Each additional day's feeding confirms this. Fully convinced of the man's benevolence, the goose is amazed when he takes it out of its enclosure on Christmas Day and slaughters it. The Christmas goose fell victim to inductive thinking, the inclination to draw universal certainties from individual observations. Philosopher David Hume used this allegory back in the 18th century to warn of its pitfalls. However, it's not just geese that are susceptible to it. An investor buys shares in StockX.
-  Hume used this allegory back in the 18th century to warn of its pitfalls. However, it's not just geese that are susceptible to it. An investor buys shares in stock X. The share price rockets, and at first he's wary. Probably a bubble, he suspects. As the stock continues to rise, even after months, his apprehension turns into excitement. This stock may never come down, especially since every day this is the case. After half a year, he invests his life savings in it, turning a blind eye to the huge cluster risk this poses. Later, the man will pay for his foolish investment.
-  Harvard has the reputation of being a top university. Many highly successful people have studied there. Does this mean that Harvard is a good school? We don't know. Perhaps the school is terrible, and it simply recruits the brightest students around. I experienced this phenomenon at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. It's said to be one of the top ten business schools in Europe, but the lessons I received, albeit 25 years ago, were mediocre. Nevertheless, many of its graduates were successful. The reason behind this is unknown. Perhaps it was due to the climate in the narrow valley, or even the cafeteria food. Most probably, it was because of the high-quality food.
-  investment, he's fallen hook, line, and sinker for induction. Inductive thinking doesn't have to be a road to ruin, though. In fact, you can make a fortune with it by sending a few emails. Here's how. Put together two stock market forecasts, one predicting that prices will rise next month and one warning of a drop. Send the first mail to 50,000 people and the second mail to a different set of 50,000. Suppose that after one month, the indices have fallen. Now you can send another email, but this time only to the 50,000 people who received a correct prediction. These 50,000 you divide into two groups. The first half results in a drop.
-  and one warning of a drop. Send the first mail to 50,000 people, and the second mail to a different set of 50,000. Suppose that after one month, the indices have fallen. Now you can send another email, but this time only to the 50,000 people who received a correct prediction. These 50,000 you divide into two groups. The first half learns the prices will increase next month, and the second half discovers they will fall. Continue doing this. After 10 months, around 100 people will remain, all of whom you've advised impeccably. From their perspective, you're a genius. You've proven that you're truly in possession of prophetic powers.

In our evolutionary past, this was even more the case. One stupid mistake, and you were dead. Everything could lead to your rapid departure from the game of life, carelessness on the hunt, an inflamed tendon, exclusion from the group, and so on. People who were reckless or gung-ho died before they could pass their genes on to the next generation. Those who remained, the cautious, survived. We are their descendants. So no wonder we feel...

-  remained, the cautious survived. We are their descendants. So no wonder we fear loss more than we value gain. Losing $100 costs you a greater amount of happiness than the delight you would feel if I gave you $100. In fact, it's been proven that emotionally a loss weighs about twice that of a similar gain. Social scientists call this loss aversion. For this reason, if you want to convince someone about something, don't focus on the advantages. Instead, highlight how it helps them dodge the disadvantages. Here's an example from a campaign promoting breast self-examination, BSE. Two differently
-  Here's an example from a campaign promoting breast self-examination, BSE. Two different leaflets were handed out to women. Pamphlet A urged, research shows that women who do BSE have an increased chance of finding a tumor in the early more treatable state of the disease. Pamphlet B said, research shows that women who do not BSE have a decreased chance of finding a tumor in the early more treatable state of the disease. The study revealed that pamphlet B, written in a loss frame, generated significantly more awareness and BSE behavior than pamphlet A, written in a gain frame. The fear of losing a tumor is a key factor in the BSE.
-  of the disease. The study revealed that pamphlet B, written in a loss frame, generated significantly more awareness and BSE behavior than pamphlet A, written in a gain frame. The fear of losing something motivates people more than the prospect of gaining something of equal value. Suppose your business is home insulation. The most effective way of encouraging customers to purchase your product is to tell them how much money they're losing without insulation, as opposed to how much money they would save with it, even though the amount is exactly the same. This type of aversion is also found on the stock market, where investors tend to simply ignore losses on paper.
-  $100 bill. What a waste of emotion. I pointed out that the value of his portfolio fluctuated by at least $100 every second. Management gurus push employees in large companies to be bolder and more entrepreneurial. The reality is, employees tend to be risk averse. From their perspective, this aversion makes perfect sense. Why risk something that brings them, at best, a nice bonus and, at worst, a pink slip? The downside is larger than the upside. In almost all companies and situations, safeguarding your career trumps any potential reward. So if you've been scratching your head about the lack of risk-takers,
-  in situations safeguarding your career trumps any potential reward. So if you've been scratching your head about the lack of risk taking among your employees, you now know why. However, if employees do take big risks, it is often when they can hide behind group decisions. Learn more in Chapter 33 on social loafing. We can't fight it. Evil is more powerful and more plentiful than good. We are more sensitive to negative than to positive things. On the street, scary faces stand out more than smiling ones. We remember bad behavior longer than good. Except, of course, when it comes to ourselves.
-  the horrendously high tuition fees pay for themselves over a short period of time. Many prospective students fall for this approach. I'm not implying that the schools doctor the statistics, but still their statements must not be swallowed wholesale. Why? Because those who pursue an MBA are different from those who do not. The income gap between both groups stems from a multitude of reasons that have nothing to do with the MBA degree itself. Once again, we see the swimmer's body illusion at work, the factor for selection confused with the result. So if you're considering further study, do it for reasons other than the MBA degree.
-  Nuremberg trials, or less controversially, any board or management team. We hide behind team decisions. The technical term for this is diffusion of responsibility. For the same reason, teams tend to take bigger risks than their members would take on their own. The individual group members reason that they're not the only ones who will be blamed if things go wrong. This effect is called risky shift and is especially hazardous among companies and pension fund strategists, where billions are at stake, or in the defense department, where groups decide on the use of nuclear weapons. In conclusion, people behave differently in groups than when alone.

Over the next 30 days, I will give you a cent on the first day, two cents on the second day, four cents on the third day, eight cents on the fourth day, and so on. Don't think too long about it. A or B. Are you ready? Well, if we assume that a sheet of copy paper is approximately 0.004 inches thick, then its thickness after 50 folds is a little over 60 million miles.

-  over 60 million miles. This equals the distance between the Earth and the Sun, as you can check easily with a calculator. With the second question, it's worthwhile choosing option B even though A sounds more tempting. Selecting A earns you $30,000 in 30 days. Choosing B gives you more than $5 million. Linear growth we understand intuitively. However, we have no sense of exponential or percentage growth. Why is this? Because we didn't need it before. Our ancestors' experiences were mostly of the linear variety. Whoever spent twice the time collecting berries earned double the money.

Because we didn't need it before. Our ancestors' experiences were mostly of the linear variety. Whoever spent twice the time collecting berries earned double the amount. Whoever hunted two mammoths instead of one could eat for twice as long. In the Stone Age, people rarely came across exponential growth. Today, things are different. Each year the number of traffic accidents rises by 7 percent, warns a politician.
-  came across exponential growth. Today, things are different. Each year the number of traffic accidents rises by 7% warns a politician. Let's be honest, we don't intuitively understand what this means. So let's use a trick and calculate the doubling time. Start with the magic number of 70 and divide it by the growth rate in percent. In this instance, 70 divided by 7 equals 10 years. So what the politician is saying, the number of traffic accidents doubles every 10 years. Pretty alarming. You may ask why the number 70. This has to do with a mathematical concept called logarithm.
-  years. So what the politician is saying, the number of traffic accidents doubles every 10 years. Pretty alarming. You may ask why the number 70. This has to do with a mathematical concept called logarithm. You can look it up in the notes section. Another example, inflation is at 5%. Whoever hears this thinks, that's not so bad. What's 5% anyway? Let's quickly calculate the doubling time. 70 divided by 5 equals 14 years. In 14 years, a dollar will be worth only half what it is today. A catastrophe for anyone who has a savings account. Suppose you're a journalist and learned that the number of registered

"'It's an honor to you, dear courtier, that you present such a modest request.' "'But how much rice is that?' The king guessed about a sack. Only when his servants began the task, placing a grain on the first square, two grains of rice on the second square, four grains of rice on the third, and so on, did he realize that he would need more rice than was growing on earth. When it comes to growth rates, the king was not surprised.

-  others are not privy to. This was not the case in Texas. The oil managers actually celebrated a Pyrrhic victory. Today, this phenomenon affects us all. From eBay to Groupon to Google AdWords, prices are consistently set by auction. Bidding wars for cell phone frequencies drive telecom companies to the brink of bankruptcy. Airports rent out their commercial spaces to the highest bidder. And if Walmart plans to introduce a new detergent and asks for tenders from five suppliers, that's nothing more than an auction, with the risk of the winner's curse. The auctioning of everyday life has now reached tradesmen, too.
-  despair the poor painter, the winner's curse. Initial public offerings, IPOs, are also examples of auctions. And when companies buy other companies, the infamous mergers and acquisitions, the winner's curse is present more often than not. Astoundingly, more than half of all acquisitions destroy value, according to a McKinsey study. So why do we fall victim to the winner's curse? First, the real value of many things is uncertain. Additionally, the more interested parties, the greater the likelihood of an overly enthusiastic bid. Second, we want to outdo competitors. A friend owns a micro antenna factory and told me
